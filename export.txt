NOTE         Daisy Fuller Williams is on her deathbed in a New Orleans 
               hospital the day that Hurricane Katrina hits. At her side is 
               her adult daughter, Caroline. Daisy asks Caroline to read to 
               her aloud from the diary of Daisy's lifelong friend, Benjamin 
               Button. Benjamin's diary recounts his entire extraordinary
               life. The unusual aspect of his life is that he is ages 
               backwards, being born an old man. He is diagnosed with several 
               aged diseases at birth and thus given little chance of
               survival. He does survive and gets younger with time. Abandoned
               by Thomas Button, his biological father, after Benjamin's 
               biological mother died in childbirth. Benjamin was raised by 
               Queenie, a black woman and caregiver at a seniors home. Daisy's
               grandmother was a resident, which is where she first met 
               Benjamin. Although separated through the years, Daisy and 
               Benjamin remain in contact throughout their lives, reconnecting
               in their forties when in age they finally match up. Some of the
               revelations in Benjamin's diary are difficult for Caroline to 
               read.

               their mission is. With Lt. Payton staying behind to guide him

               and begins to uncover a terrifying reality. Slowly the

               zombie-slayer who ever lived. When they meet two sisters, 
               Wichita and Little Rock, the four strike out for an amusement 
               park that is said to be zombie-free. This mismatched group will
               have to rely on each other to survive, which could be worse 
               than surrendering to the zombies.

NOTE         A rat named Remy dreams of becoming a great chef despite his 
               family's wishes and the obvious problem of being a rat in a 
               decidedly rodent-phobic profession. When fate places Remy in 
               Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant 
               made famous by his culinary hero. Despite the apparent dangers 
               of being an unwanted visitor in the kitchen of one of Paris' 
               most exclusive restaurants, Remy forms an unlikely partnership 
               with Linguini, the garbage boy, who inadvertently discovers 
               Remy's amazing talents. They strike a deal, ultimately setting 
               into motion a chain of extraordinary events that turns the 
               culinary world of Paris upside down.

NOTE         Carl Fredericksen is a 78- year-old curmudgeon. He used to enjoy 
               his modest life as a balloon seller when his adventure-loving 
               wife Ellie was still alive. When she died, Carl was left with 
               his memories and the awareness that they never made their dream
               journey to Paradise Falls in South America. When well-meaning 
               officials consign Carl to Shady Oaks Retirement Home, he rigs 
               thousands of helium balloons to his house and floats away. He 
               discovers that Russell, a chubby Wilderness Explorer Scout has 
               stowed away. In the tropical jungle, Carl and Russell find more
               than they bargained for. Charles Muntz is a crazed explorer 
               whose newsreels once inspired Carl and Ellie; Kevin is an 
               exotic bird with a weakness for chocolate; and Dug who is an 
               endearingly golden retriever fitted with a voice box. More 
               importantly, Carl and Russell discover they need each other.

NOTE         Flint Lockwood is a young inventor who dreams of creating 
               something that will improve everyone's life. Sam Sparks is a 
               weathergirl covering the town's weather phenomenon, but chooses
               to hide her intelligence behind a perky exterior. Tim Lockwood 
               is Flint's technophobic father. Brent is the town bully who has
               plagued Flint since childhood. Mayor Shelbourne exploits 
               Flint's newest invention so he can put the town, and more 
               importantly himself, on the map. By-the-rules town cop Earl 
               Devereaux has a rule-breaking son, Cal. In a town where food 
               drops from the sky like rain, Flint hopes to create something 
               that will change everyone's life. However, when the weather 
               takes a turn for the worse, the residents of the town of 
               Chewandswallow will find their eating habits have drastically 
               changed.

NOTE         With two professional assassinations in quick succession, James 
               Bond is quickly elevated to '00' status. Bond's first 007 
               mission takes him to Uganda where he is to spy on a terrorist, 
               Mollaka. Not everything goes to plan and Bond decides to 
               investigate, independently of MI6, in order to track down the 
               rest of the terrorist cell. Following a lead to the Bahamas, he
               encounters Dimitrios and his girlfriend, Solange. He learns 
               that Dimitrios is involved with Le Chiffre, banker to the
               world's terrorist organizations. Intelligence reveals that Le 
               Chiffre is planning to raise money in a high-stakes poker game 
               in Montenegro at Le Casino Royale. MI6 assigns 007 to play 
               against him, knowing that if Le Chiffre loses, it will destroy 
               his organization. 'M' places Bond under the watchful eye of the
               beguiling Vesper Lynd. At first skeptical of what value Vesper 
               can provide, Bond's interest in her deepens as they brave 
               danger together and even torture at the hands of Le Chiffre. 
               The marathon game proceeds with dirty tricks and violence, 
               raising the stakes beyond blood money and reaching a terrifying
               climax.

NOTE         Marty Bronson raises his son and daughter on his own. He has to 
               sell his homey motel to Barry Nottingham who promises to make 
               Marty's son manager. But, Nottingham pulls down the motel and 
               builds a pricey hotel. Now grown up, Marty's son, Skeeter, 
               works as a janitor and general servant. He still dreams of 
               becoming the manager. When Nottingham announces a brand-new 
               hotel, built on an existing school's property, he makes his 
               future son-in-law, Kendall, manager. Skeeter's sister Wendy, 
               has to leave town for a job interview and asks him to alternate
               looking after her two children Patrick and Bobbi, with Wendy's 
               colleague, Jill. He doesn't get along with either Jill or the 
               children, but his easy-going attitude loosens them all up. He 
               starts telling the children bedtime stories and the children 
               grow fond of him. They make suggestions about how the stories 
               should go. When the stories become true in real life, Skeeter 
               tries to maneuver the stories into a direction which will make 
               his dream come true, too.

NOTE         When the Museum of Natural History is closed for renovations, the
               museum pieces are moved into federal storage at the famous 
               Smithsonian Institution. It houses the world's largest museum 
               complex with more than 136 million items in its collections. 
               These range from the plane Amelia Earhart flew on her non-stop 
               solo flight across the Atlantic and Al Capone's rap sheet and 
               mug shot to Dorothy's ruby slippers. From Fonzie's leather 
               jacket to Archie Bunker's lounge chair. After stealing a 
               security guard's ID badge, Larry Daley slips into the Archives 
               of the Smithsonian, where Kahmunrah, an evil Pharaoh, comes to 
               life with the reestablishing of The Tablet as a magical force 
               in the museum. It brings the old exhibits and new exhibits to 
               life, and in conflict with each other. Larry enlists the help 
               of Amelia Earheart.

NOTE         Mr. and Mrs. Fox live a happy home life underground with their 
               eccentric son Ash. Mr. Fox works as a journalist, but against 
               the advice of Badger, his attorney, he moves his family into a 
               larger and finer home inside a tree on a hill. The treehouse 
               has an excellent view of the nearby farms of Boggis, Bunce, and
               Bean. Ash becomes hostile when his cousin, Kristofferson, joins
               the family for an extended stay. Mr. Fox decides to raid the 
               farms, but this leads the farmers to stakeout the treehouse. 
               The farmers try to dig the Fox family out, but they dig even 
               faster. Mr. Fox organizes a tunneling project to burrow under 
               all three farms and steal all the chickens, ducks, geese and 
               turkeys.

NOTE         In the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC an alliance of Greek city-
               states fought the invading Persian army in the mountain pass of
               Thermopylae. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the enemy
               in one of the most famous last stands of history. Persian King 
               Xerxes lead a Army of well over 100,000 men to Greece and was 
               confronted by 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians and other Slave 
               soldiers. Xerxes waited many days for King Leonidas to 
               surrender or withdraw. When the Greeks did not leave, Xerxes 
               was left with no option and he moved forward. The battle lasted
               for about 3 days and after which all 300 Spartans were killed. 
               The Spartan defeat would not have happened if not for a local 
               shepherd, named Ephialtes, who defected to the Persians and 
               informed Xerxes of a separate path through Thermopylae, which 
               the Persians could use to outflank the Greeks.

               his crew, is well regarded by his men, who trust him
               implicitly, even after the first devastating battle and an 
               apparent personal vendetta against the French captain. The
               ship's surgeon balances the violence of his chosen life with 
               the quiet demeanor of the scientist. He is the captain's friend
               and confidant, the two frequently playing violin and cello 
               duets together.

NOTE         Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous 
               art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within 
               the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at 
               its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted
               player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, 
               but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him
               everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a 
               chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back
               but only if he can accomplish the impossible--inception. 
               Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists 
               have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an 
               idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect
               crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can 
               prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict 
               their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen 
               coming.

NOTE         Disney's fantastical adventure Oz The Great And Powerful, from 
               the director of the Spider-Man trilogy, follows Oscar Diggs, a 
               small-time circus magician with dubious ethics. When Diggs is 
               hurled away to the vibrant Land of Oz, he thinks he's hit the 
               jackpot--until he meets three witches who aren't convinced he's
               the great wizard everyone's expecting. Reluctantly drawn into 
               epic problems facing Oz and its inhabitants, Oscar must find 
               out who is good and who is evil before it's too late. Putting 
               his magical arts to use through illusion, ingenuity--and even 
               some wizardry--Oscar transforms himself into the great wizard 
               and a better man as well.

NOTE         It's thwarted-business-as-usual for Dr. Doofenshmirtz, until a 
               blast from his power-drain-inator ricochets off of Phineas and 
               Ferb's space station, hitting Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk, 
               and Thor. Now the kids must restore the super heroes' lost 
               powers before a group of dastardly super-villains destroy the 
               planet! Fortunately, Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. are also on the
               case, together with O.W.C.A.'s top agent, Perry the Platypus.

               rely on one another more than ever. But there are dark forces 
               in their midst that threaten to tear them apart.  Harry's only

NOTE         In this beautifully shot and acted, psychologically complex 
               western, Van Heflin is a mild-mannered cattle rancher who takes
               on the task of shepherding a captured outlaw, played with 
               cucumber-cool charisma by Glenn Ford, to the train that will 
               take him to prison. This apparently simple plan turns into a 
               nerve-racking cat-and-mouse game that will test each man's 
               particular brand of honor.

NOTE         Indian peoples made some four hundred treaties with the United 
               States between the American Revolution and 1871, when Congress 
               prohibited them. They signed nine treaties with the
               Confederacy, as well as countless others over the centuries 
               with Spain, France, Britain, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, 
               Canada, and even Russia, not to mention individual colonies and
               states. In retrospect, the treaties seem like well-ordered 
               steps on the path of dispossession and empire. The reality was 
               far more complicated. In Pen and Ink Witchcraft, eminent Native
               American historian Colin G. Calloway narrates the history of 
               diplomacy between North American Indians and their imperial 
               adversaries, particularly the United States.
NOTE         Includes bibliographical references (pages 285-350) and index.

               places with a devious circus grizzly and falls for a troupe 
               member, he'll come to realize that maybe you don't have to

NOTE         In this spoof of disaster movies, Ted Striker, an ex-Navy pilot, 
               just got dumped by his long-time girlfriend Elaine Dickinson, 
               who works as a stewardess. In his wish to get her back, he 
               follows her aboard a plane, although he has had a deep aversion
               against anything winged since he lost several men in the war. 
               During flight, he tries to make up with her again and again, 
               but a crisis looms as the crew and many passengers get 
               seriously ill due to a bad fish meal. Now, it is up to him to 
               land the airplane safely, before the poisoning starts causing 
               casualties. But Ted Striker's aversion to piloting is a serious
               psychosis, which breaks open and needs to be cured--right now.

               Gretel have turned pro, coping with the trauma of their 
               childhood captivity by slaying witches for hire. But when the 
               seemingly unstoppable bounty hunters meet their match in an 
               enemy so evil, it'll take all their training, weapons and 
               courage to survive. Revenge is sweeter than candy.

NOTE         The fate of a young nation rests in the hands of a reluctant 
               warrior in the thrilling sixth volume of the New York Times 
               bestselling Saxon Tales series. Following the intrigue and 
               action of The Burning Land and Sword Song, this latest chapter 
               in Bernard Cornwell's epic saga of England is a gripping tale 
               of divided loyalties and mounting chaos. At a crucial moment in
               time, as Alfred the Great lays dying, the fate of all--Angles, 
               Saxons, and Vikings alike--hangs desperately in the balance.

NOTE         "New York Times bestselling author Bernard Cornwell returns to 
               his epic Saxon Tales saga with The Pagan Lord, a dramatic story
               of divided loyalties, bloody battles, and the struggle to unite
               Britain.At the onset of the tenth century, England is in 
               turmoil. Alfred the Great is dead and Edward his son reigns as 
               king. Wessex survives but peace cannot hold: the Danes in the 
               north, led by Viking Cnut Longsword, stand ready to invade and 
               will never rest until the emerald crown is theirs. Uhtred, once
               Alfred's great warrior but now out of favor with the new king, 
               must lead a band of outcasts north to recapture his old family 
               home, that great Northumbrian fortress, Bebbanburg.In The Pagan
               Lord, loyalties will be divided and men will fall, as every 
               Saxon kingdom is drawn into the bloodiest battle yet with the 
               Danes; a war which will decide the fate of every king, and the 
               entire English nation"-- Provided by publisher.

               old acquaintance.

NOTE         Welcome to Chima, a magical world of untamed nature, beauty, and 
               wonder ruled by animal tribes. A world where chi, the power of 
               nature itself, is carefully guarded by the lions but equally 
               shared among the tribes so all animals can live and thrive 
               peacefully. A world where Laval the lion and Cragger the 
               crocodile are the best of friends. When Cragger is made king, 
               everything is thrown out of balance, alliances are made, and 
               friends are now worst enemies.

NOTE         Ender Wiggin, the hero and scapegoat of mass alien destruction in
               Ender's Game, receives a chance at redemption in this novel. 
               Ender, who proclaimed as a mistake his success in wiping out an
               alien race, wins the opportunity to cope better with a second 
               race, discovered by Portuguese colonists on the planet 
               Lusitania. Orson Scott Card infuses this long, ambitious tale 
               with intellect by casting his characters in social, religious 
               and cultural contexts.

TITLE        The China fantasy : how our leaders explain away Chinese 
               repression / James Mann.
PUB INFO     New York : Viking, 2007.
DESCRIPT     xiii, 127 p. ; 22 cm.
NOTE         Includes bibliographical references (p. [115]-120) and index.
NOTE         ""Journalist and China expert Mann examines the evolution of 
               American policy toward China and asks, Does it make sense? What
               are our ideas and hidden assumptions about China? In this 
               vigorous look at China's political evolution and its future, 
               Mann explores two scenarios popular among the policy elite. The
               Soothing Scenario contends that the spread of capitalism will 
               gradually bring about a development of democratic institutions 
               and a progressive human rights policy. In the Upheaval
               Scenario, the contradictions between rich and poor, between 
               cities and the countryside, and between the openness of the 
               economy and the unyielding Leninist system will eventually lead
               to a revolution, chaos, or collapse. Against this backdrop, 
               Mann poses a third scenario: What will happen if Chinese 
               capitalism continues to evolve and expand but the government 
               fails to liberalize? He explores this alternate possibility and
               offers a startling vision of our future with China."--From 
               publisher description."--From source other than the Library of 
               Congress.

               life growing up in a peaceable forest kingdom, until one day 
               when an invading army threatens the harmony of the land. Bent 
               on revenge, Maleficent faces a battle with the invading king's 
               successor and, as a result, places a curse upon his newborn 
               infant Aurora. As the child grows, Maleficent realizes that 
               Aurora holds the key to peace in the kingdom, and perhaps to 
               Maleficent's true happiness as well.

NOTE         A battle is looming at Camelot Middle School--a battle of the 
               bands, that is! Artie, Wayne, and Percy enter the talent show 
               seeking fame and fortune. But only one of them plays an 
               instrument: Percy. And he plays the tuba. Their only hope of 
               winning is finding the long-lost "Singing Sword," the fabled 
               instrument of awesome power.

TITLE        Darth Vader and son / Jeffrey Brown.
PUB INFO     San Francisco : Chronicle Books, c2012.
DESCRIPT     1 v. (unpaged) : col. ill. ; 18 cm.
NOTE         "What if Darth Vader took an active role in raising his son? What
               if 'Luke, I am your father' was just a stern admonishment from 
               an annoyed dad? In this hilarious and sweet comic reimagining, 
               Darth Vader is a dad like any other-- except with all the 
               baggage of being the Dark Lord of the Sith. Celebrated artist 
               Jeffrey Brown's delightful illustrations give classic Star Wars
               moments a fresh twist, presenting the trials and joys of 
               parenting through the lens of a galaxy far, far away. Life 
               lessons include lightsaber batting practice, using the Force to
               raid the cookie jar, Take Your Child to Work Day on the Death 
               Star ('Er, he looks just like you, Lord Vader!'), and the 
               special bond shared between any father and son" -- from

NOTE         "Bringing together characters from Oryx and Crake and The Year of
               the Flood, this thrilling conclusion to Margaret Atwood's 
               speculative fiction trilogy confirms the ultimate endurance of 
               humanity, community, and love. Months after the Waterless Flood
               pandemic has wiped out most of humanity, Toby and Ren have 
               rescued their friend Amanda from the vicious Painballers. They 
               return to the MaddAddamite cob house, which is being fortified 
               against man and giant Pigoon alike. Accompanying them are the 
               Crakers, the gentle, quasihuman species engineered by the 
               brilliant but deceased Crake. While their reluctant prophet, 
               Jimmy--Crake's one-time friend--recovers from a debilitating 
               fever, it's left to Toby to narrate the Craker theology, with 
               Crake as Creator. She must also deal with cultural 
               misunderstandings, terrible coffee, and her jealousy over her 
               lover, Zeb. Meanwhile, Zeb searches for Adam One, founder of 
               the God's Gardeners, the pacifist green religion from which Zeb
               broke years ago to lead the MaddAddamites in active resistance 
               against the destructive CorpSeCorps. Now, under threat of an 
               imminent Painballer attack, the MaddAddamites must fight back 
               with the aid of their newfound allies, some of whom have four 
               trotters. At the center is the extraordinary story of Zeb's 
               past, which involves a lost brother, a hidden murder, a bear, 
               and a bizarre act of revenge. Combining adventure, humor, 
               romance, superb storytelling, and an imagination that is at 
               once dazzlingly inventive and grounded in a recognizable world,
               MaddAddam is vintage Margaret Atwood, and a moving and dramatic
               conclusion to her internationally celebrated dystopian
               trilogy"-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         Ren MacCormack moves from Boston to the small town of Bomont, 
               where he experiences a heavy dose of culture shock. A few years
               prior, the community was rocked by a tragic accident that 
               killed five teenagers after a night out. Bomont's councilmen 
               and the beloved Reverend Shaw Moore responded by invoking 
               ordinances that prohibit loud music and dancing. Not one to bow
               to the status quo, Ren challenges the ban, revitalizes the
               town, and falls in love with the minister's troubled daughter, 
               Ariel.

               an ancient, powerful new menace sets Earth in its crosshairs. 
               With help from a new cast of humans, Optimus Prime and the 
               Autobots rise to meet their most fearsome challenge yet. In an 
               incredible adventure, they are swept up in a war of good and 
               evil, ultimately leading to a climactic battle across the
               world.

NOTE         For twenty years Claire Randall has kept her secrets. But now she
               is returning with her grown daughter to Scotland's majestic 
               mist-shrouded hills. Here Claire plans to reveal a truth as 
               stunning as the events that gave it birth: about the mystery of
               an ancient circle of standing stones ... about a love that 
               transcends the boundaries of time ... and about James Fraser, a
               Scottish warrior whose gallantry once drew a young Claire from 
               the security of her century to the dangers of his. Now a legacy
               of blood and desire will test her beautiful copper-haired 
               daughter, Brianna, as Claire's spellbinding journey of self-
               discovery continues in the intrigue-ridden Paris court of 
               Charles Stuart ... in a race to thwart a doomed Highlands 
               uprising ... and in a desperate fight to save both the child 
               and the man she loves.

NOTE         It began for our narrator forty years ago when the family lodger 
               stole their car and committed suicide in it, stirring up 
               ancient powers best left undisturbed. Dark creatures from 
               beyond the world are on the loose, and it will take everything 
               our narrator has just to stay alive: there is primal horror 
               here, and menace unleashed - within his family and from the 
               forces that have gathered to destroy it. His only defense is 
               three women, on a farm at the end of the lane. The youngest of 
               them claims that her duckpond is ocean. The oldest can remember
               the Big Bang.

NOTE         In a near future, an alien race has hit the Earth in an 
               unbeatable assault. Major William Cage has never seen a day of 
               combat, but is dropped into a suicide mission and killed within
               minutes. Cage now finds himself thrown into a time loop-forcing
               him to live out the same day over and over, fighting and dying 
               each time. With each "life", Cage learns more fighting skills, 
               so that when he and warrior Rita Vrataski take the fight to the
               aliens, they are one step closer to defeating the enemy.

               dilapidated zoo, replete with 200 exotic animals facing 
               destruction, in the English countryside. Mee, along with his 
               children, had to balance caring for his wife, who was dying of 
               brain cancer, with dealing with escaped tigers, raising 
               endangered animals, working with an eclectic skeleton crew and 
               readying the zoo for a reopening.

NOTE         "In her now classic novel Outlander, Diana Gabaldon told the 
               story of Claire Randall, an English ex-combat nurse who walks 
               through a stone circle in the Scottish Highlands in 1946, and 
               disappears into 1743...Now the story continues in Written in My
               Own Heart's Blood. 1778: France declares war on Great Britain, 
               the British army leaves Philadelphia, and George Washington's 
               troops leave Valley Forge in pursuit. At this moment, Jamie 
               Fraser returns from a presumed watery grave to discover that 
               his best friend has married his wife, his illegitimate son has 
               discovered (to his horror) who his father really is, and his 
               beloved nephew, Ian, wants to marry a Quaker. Meanwhile, 
               Jamie's wife, Claire, and his sister, Jenny, are busy picking 
               up the pieces. The Frasers can only be thankful that their 
               daughter Brianna and her family are safe in twentieth-century 
               Scotland, or not. In fact, Brianna is searching for her own
               son, who was kidnapped by a man determined to learn her 
               family's secrets. Her husband, Roger, has ventured into the 
               past in search of the missing boy never suspecting that the 
               object of his quest has not left the present. Now, with Roger 
               out of the way, the kidnapper can focus on his true target: 
               Brianna herself"--Provided by publisher.

NOTE         A history of turbulent U.S.-China relations from the 19th century
               to World War II and Mao's ascent.
NOTE         "In each of his books, James Bradley has exposed the hidden 
               truths behind America's engagement in Asia. Now comes his most 
               engrossing work yet. Beginning in the 1850s, Bradley introduces
               us to the prominent Americans who made their fortunes in the 
               China opium trade. As they---good Christians all---profitably 
               addicted millions, American missionaries arrived, promising 
               salvation for those who adopted Western ways. And that was just
               the beginning. From drug dealer Warren Delano to his grandson 
               Franklin Delano Roosevelt, from the port of Hong Kong to the 
               towers of Princeton University, from the era of Appomattox to 
               the age of the A-Bomb, THE CHINA MIRAGE explores a difficult 
               century that defines U.S.-Chinese relations to this day" --

TITLE        At the point of a cutlass : the pirate capture, bold escape, & 
               lonely exile of Philip Ashton / Gregory N. Flemming. .

NOTE         Taken in a surprise attack near Nova Scotia in June 1722, Ashton 
               was forced to sail across the Atlantic and back with a crew 
               under the command of Edward Low, a man so vicious he tortured 
               victims by slicing off an ear or nose and roasting them over a 
               fire. "A greater monster," one colonial official wrote, "never 
               infested the seas." Ashton barely survived the nine months he 
               sailed with Low's crew -- he was nearly shot in the head at 
               gunpoint, came close to drowning when a ship sank near the 
               coast of Brazil, and was almost hanged for secretly plotting a 
               revolt against the pirates. Like many forced men, Ashton 
               thought constantly about escaping. In March of 1723, he saw his
               chance when Low's crew anchored at the secluded island of 
               Roatan, at the western edge of the Caribbean. Ashton fled into 
               the thick, overgrown woods and, for more than a year, had to 
               claw out a living on the remote strip of land, completely alone
               and with practically nothing to sustain him. The opportunity to
               escape came so unexpectedly that Ashton ran off without a gun, 
               a knife, or even a pair of shoes on his feet. Yet the resilient
               young castaway -- who has been called America's real-life 
               Robinson Crusoe -- was able to find food, build a crude
               shelter, and even survive a debilitating fever brought on by 
               the cool winter rains before he was rescued by a band of men 
               sailing near the island.

               a rookie soldier thrust into their platoon, Wardaddy and his 
               men face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to strike 
               at the heart of Nazi Germany.

NOTE         "Secret service agent Ethan Burke arrives in Wayward Pines,
               Idaho, with a clear mission: locate and recover two federal 
               agents who went missing in the bucolic town one month earlier. 
               But within minutes of his arrival, Ethan is involved in a 
               violent accident. He comes to in a hospital, with no ID, no 
               cell phone, and no briefcase. The medical staff seems friendly 
               enough, but something feels ... off. As the days pass, Ethan's 
               investigation into the disappearance of his colleagues turns up
               more questions than answers. Why can't he get any phone calls 
               through to his wife and son in the outside world? Why doesn't 
               anyone believe he is who he says he is? And what is the purpose
               of the electrified fences surrounding the town? Are they meant 
               to keep the residents in? Or something else out? Each step 
               closer to the truth takes Ethan further from the world he 
               thought he knew, from the man he thought he was, until he must 
               face a horrifying fact - he may never get out of Wayward Pines 
               alive"--Author's website.

NOTE         "Mystery novel about friendship, love, and aging. Synopsis: In 
               the wanting months of the second World War, a group of children
               discover an earthen tunnel in their neighborhood. Throughout 
               the summer of 1944--until one father forbids it--the 
               subterranean space becomes their "secret garden," where the 
               friends play games and tell stories. Six decades later, beneath
               a house on the same land, construction workers uncover a tin 
               box containing two skeletal hands, one male and one female. As 
               the discovery makes national news, the friends come together 
               once again, to recall their days in the tunnel for the 
               detective investigating the case. Is the truth buried among 
               these aging friends and memories? This impromptu reunion causes
               long-simmering feelings to bubble to the surface. Mild-mannered
               Alan, stuck in a passionless marriage, begins flirting with 
               Daphne, a glamorous widow who was once his teenage sweetheart. 
               Michael, lonely after the death of his wife, considers 
               contacting his estranged father, who sent Michael to live with 
               an aunt after his mother vanished in 1944. Lewis begins 
               remembering details about his Uncle James, an army private who 
               once accompanied the Children into the tunnels, and who later 
               disappeared. In THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, Rendell brilliantly 
               shatters our assumptions about age, showing that the choices 
               people make--and the emotions behind them--remain as potent in 
               late life as they were in youth"-- Provided by publisher.

SERIES       Wayward Pines Series book two.
NOTE         Welcome to Wayward Pines, population 461. The town is a modern-
               day Eden... except for the electrified fence and razor wire, 
               snipers scoping everything 24/7, and the relentless 
               surveillance tracking each word and gesture. Ethan Burke has 
               seen the world beyond. He's sheriff, and one of the few who 
               knows the truth-- Wayward Pines isn't just a town. And what 
               lies on the other side of the fence is a nightmare beyond 
               anyone's imagining....

NOTE         Secret Service agent Ethan Burke arrived in Wayward Pines, Idaho,
               three weeks ago. In this town, people are told who to marry, 
               where to live, where to work. Their children are taught that 
               David Pilcher, the town's creator, is god. No one is allowed to
               leave; even asking questions can get them killed. But Ethan has
               discovered the astonishing secret of what lies beyond the 
               electrified fence that surrounds Wayward Pines and protects it 
               from the terrifying world beyond.

               stands a chance of surviving. San Francisco, California. Father
               Xavier Church has spent his life ministering to unfortunate 
               souls, but he has never witnessed horror like this. After he 
               forsakes his vows in the most heartrending of ways, he watches 
               helplessly as a zombie nun takes a bite out of a fellow 
               priest's face; University of California, Berkeley. Skye 
               Dennison is moving into her college dorm for the first time, 
               simultaneously excited to be leaving the nest and terrified to 
               be on her own. When her mother and father are eaten alive in 
               front of her, she realizes the terror has just begun; Alameda, 
               California. Angie West made millions off her family's reality 
               gun show on the History Channel. But after she is cornered by 
               the swarming undead, her knowledge of heavy artillery is called
               into play like never before; Within weeks, the world is overrun
               by the walking dead. Only the quick and the smart, the strong 
               and the determined, will survive-for now. "-- Provided by

NOTE         "HALO: GLASSLANDS saw a very different development in the war 
               that Earth has been fighting for so very long. With terrible 
               losses on both sides, finally open hostilities have ended. But 
               though a fragile peace has been established between Earth and 
               the peoples of the Covenant, forces on both sides make that 
               peace precarious. A schism among the Sangheili is gaining 
               strength, with a splinter group trying to unseat the leader who
               agreed to peace; and while some Human colonies rebel against 
               Earth authority, the official policy of ONI changes as the 
               volatile situation in space shifts with new developments. 
               Having discovered a trove of Forerunner technology on Onyx, 
               Earth now seeks to find uses for it in the conflict. For the

SERIES       Moorcock, Michael, 1939- Corum.
NOTE         The ancient races, the Vadhagh and the Nhadragh, are dying. By 
               creating Mankind, the universe has condemned Earth to a 
               pestilence of destruction and fear. Prince Corum is the last 
               remaining Vadhagh. He sets out on a crusade of vengeance 
               against the forces that slaughtered his family and his race, to
               challenge the unjust power of the puppet masters of Man: the 
               Lords of Chaos. Along the way he will barter with his soul for 
               the limbs of gods to repair his mutilated body, and will 
               encounter a member of the very race who caused the mutilation, 
               the irresistible Rhalina.

NOTE         Prince Corum has defeated the Chaos Lord Arioch. But any peace 
               for him and his faithful Rhalina is brief. His actions have 
               evoked the murderous anger of Arioch's sister, the dreaded 
               Xiombarg. The Prince in the Scarlet Robe must continue his 
               odyssey, face the terror of the Mabden armies, and challenge 
               the might of the Queen of the Swords. Faced with immense powers
               of evil on all sides, only the legendary City of the Pyramid 
               offers a glimmer of hope. But Corum must get there first, and 
               along the way he will encounter horrifying creatures, strange 
               forms of sorcery, and new planes of existence.

NOTE         Originally published in 1971.
NOTE         "The old races have perished. Across the fifteen planes of 
               reality, the ceaseless struggle between Law and Chaos
               continues. Corum, the Prince in the Scarlet Robe, has destroyed
               two of the company of Chaos, but Mabelode the Faceless will not
               see his actions go unpunished. The Eternal Champion must call 
               upon the power of other incarnations--Elric, and Erekosë--and 
               travel to the last five planes to defeat the King of the
               Swords. At stake: not only the balance of forces at the crux of
               existence, but also a personal vendetta, since the captain of 
               the enemy army is the same Mabden who slaughtered Corum's 
               family..."--Page 4 of cover.

NOTE         Peril is possibly the most dangerous dragon in Pyrrhia, because 
               she has firescales that can kill an opponent with a touch, but 
               now she has a mission--find her former queen, Scarlet, who is 
               threatening the Jade Mountain Academy, and then stop her, and 
               she is not sure if the persistent SeaWing, Turtle, who is 
               accompanying her, will be a help or a hindrance.

NOTE         "There is a sword, forged by the master swordsmith Goffanon the 
               Dwarf, imbued with powerfully magical properties. But this 
               magic can only be wielded by one man. And there is a stallion--
               a fierce animal that allows only those pure of heart to ride
               it. The only man worthy of taking up this sword, and climbing 
               into this saddle, is Prince Corum--the Eternal Champion. The 
               struggle for dominion between the races of good and evil is 
               reaching an epic crescendo, and the formidable Gods of Limbo 
               threaten to deliver unending Chaos to the world. Corum's most 
               desperate quest yet will see treachery, betrayal, wizards, 
               dragons and brutal battle, all of which will decide the fate of
               the Earth, and of Corum himself." -- Amazon.com.

NOTE         In the ancient Castle Erorn, Corum of the Scarlet Robe dwells in 
               isolation and sorrow. He has out-lived his great love, Rhalina,
               and is tormented by voices in his dreams--a crowd of shadowy 
               figures chanting his name. Unable to ignore their calls for 
               help any longer, he will travel through eons of time to an age 
               of tragedy, where the people of Tuha-na-Cremm Croich, 
               descendants of Rhalina, are persecuted by the giant gods of the
               Cold Folk. A great black bull has the power needed to defeat 
               the monsters of a new age. But to tame the bull, the Eternal 
               Champion must travel to the fatally beautiful island of Hy-
               Breasail to find the invincible and magical Spear Bryionak...

NOTE         "Spring has turned to summer, the hottest and most abundant 
               summer ever remembered in the Mabden lands. But in the mists 
               lurks an insidious coldness--the icy presence of the Fhoi
               Myore. Despite being slowly decayed by the warmth of the world,
               these harbingers of death will stop at nothing to overwhelm the
               Earth. The High King of the Mabden, Amergin, must unite the 
               race in the fight against the Fhoi Myore. But Amergin is in 
               thrall to the dark magic of the Gods of Limbo. It falls to 
               Corum of the Silver Hand to restore the rightful power of the 
               High King with the miraculous forces of two legendary
               talismans: the Golden Oak and the Silver Ram..."--Page 4 of

TITLE        The king's justice : two novellas / Stephen R. Donaldson.

NOTE         "Two new, original novellas. Donaldson's first publication since 
               finishing the Thomas Covenant series, are a sure cause for 
               celebration among his many fans. In The King's Justice, a 
               stranger dressed in black arrives in the village of Settle's 
               Crossways, following the scent of a terrible crime. He even 
               calls himself "Black," though almost certainly that is not his 
               name. The people of the village discover that they have a 
               surprising urge to cooperate with this stranger, though the 
               desire of inhabitants of quiet villages to cooperate with 
               strangers is not common in their land, or most lands. But this 
               gift will not save him as he discovers the nature of the evil 
               concealed in Settle's Crossways. The "Augur's Gambit" is a 
               daring plan created by Mayhew Gordian, Hieronomer to the Queen 
               of Indemnie, a plan to save his Queen and his country. Gordian 
               is a reader of entrails. In the bodies of chickens, lambs, 
               piglets, and one stillborn infant he sees the same message: the
               island nation of Indemnie is doomed. But even in the face of 
               certain destruction a man may fight, and the Hieronomer is 
               utterly loyal to his beautiful Queen--and to her only daughter.
               The "Augur's Gambit" is his mad attempt to save a kingdom"--

NOTE         Originally published: New York : Berkley Prime Crime, 2000.
NOTE         "As a midwife in the turn-of-the-century tenements of New York 
               City, Sarah Brandt has seen suffering and joy, birth and
               death--and even murder. And the crime-ridden streets of the 
               teeming city offer little relief from either...Thinking she has
               been summoned by German immigrant Agnes Otto to usher a new 
               life into the world, Sarah Brandt is greeted by the news of an 
               untimely death instead. It seems that Agnes's beautiful young 
               sister, Gerda, had fallen into the life of a 'Charity Girl.' 
               Caught up in the false glamour of the city's nightlife, she 
               would trade her company--and her favors--not for money, but for
               lavish gifts and an evening's entertainment. And now she was 
               dead, victim, no doubt, at the hands of one of her 'gentlemen 
               friends.' No one cares much about the fate of girls like
               Gerda--but Sarah does. And she vows to find her killer. To do 
               so, she turns to Detective Sergeant Frank Malloy. As the two 
               pursue an investigation that leads from the bright lights of 
               Coney Island to the stately homes of Fifth Avenue, they find 
               that their shared passion for justice may cost them
               dearly..."--Cover, p. 4.

NOTE         When General George Washington beat a hasty retreat from New York
               City in August 1776, many thought the American Revolution might
               soon be over. Instead, Washington rallied -- thanks in large 
               part to a little-known, top-secret group called the Culper Spy 
               Ring. Washington realized that he couldn't beat the British 
               with military might, so he recruited a sophisticated and deeply
               secretive intelligence network to infiltrate New York. So 
               carefully guarded were the members' identities that one spy's 
               name was not uncovered until the twentieth century, and one 
               remains unknown today. But by now, historians have discovered 
               enough information about the ring's activities to piece 
               together evidence that these six individuals turned the tide of
               the war. These secret six are Robert Townsend, Austin Roe, 
               Caleb Brewster, Abraham Woodhull, James Rivington, and a woman 
               known only by her assigned number, Agent 355. Here, these spies
               finally take their place among the pantheon of heroes of the 
               American Revolution.

               fantastical world of pirates, warriors and fairies called 
               Neverland, where he finds amazing adventures and fights life
               -or-death battles while trying to uncover the secret of his 
               mother, who left him at the orphanage.

NOTE         The Treaty of Paris in 1783 formally ended the American 
               Revolutionary War, but it was the pivotal campaigns and battles
               of 1781 that decided the final outcome. 1781 was one of those 
               rare years in American history when the future of the nation 
               hung by a thread, and only the fortitude, determination, and 
               sacrifice of its leaders and citizenry ensured its survival.

               emotions live in Headquarters, the control center inside

               but one thing is clear: Chicago is like a giant powder keg 
               about to explode. An army of firemen is trying to help, but 
               this fire is a ferocious beast that wants to devour everything 
               in its path, including Oscar! Will Oscar survive one of the

NOTE         "Sarah Brandt is shattered when she learns that a woman has 
               inquired at Hope's Daughters Mission for Catherine, the 
               abandoned child she has taken as her daughter. The woman claims
               she was Catherine's nursemaid, now acting on behalf of the
               girl's mother to reunite them. Unwilling to simply hand 
               Catherine over to a complete stranger, Sarah asks Malloy to 
               investigate. But when he goes to interview the woman at her 
               tenement in Chelsea, he finds she has been murdered. Though her
               death leaves Sarah's claim to Catherine unchallenged, her sense
               of justice compels her to work with Malloy to find the killer. 
               Their search takes them from the marble mansions of the Upper 
               West Side to the dilapidated dwellings of lower Manhattan and 
               into the deepest and darkest secrets of Catherine's past. And 
               while Malloy helps Sarah determine the fate of the child she 
               loves, he faces a challenge of his own--and his decision could 
               change both their lives forever.."-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         "When facing injustice, the residents of nineteenth-century New 
               York City's tenements turn to midwife Sarah Brandt and 
               Detective Sergeant Frank Malloy to protect their rights. Now, 
               as the Edgar and Agatha Award-nominated series continues, the 
               two must track down a cruel criminal preying on the hopes and 
               dreams of innocent women A Gaslight Mystery Frank Malloy has 
               never known any life other than that of a cop, but his newfound
               inheritance threatens his position within his department. While
               trying to keep both his relationship with Sarah and his fortune
               under wraps, he's assigned to a new case-finding a missing 
               young woman for her worried father, Henry Livingston. It seems 
               the girl had been responding to "lonely hearts" ads in the 
               paper for months before she disappeared. Her father thinks that
               she's eloped with a deceptive stranger, but Malloy fears the 
               worst, knowing that the grifters who place such ads often do 
               much more than simply abscond with their victims. But as Sarah 
               and Malloy delve deeper into a twisted plot targeting the 
               city's single women, it's their partnership-both professional 
               and private-that winds up in the greatest peril"-- Provided by 
               publisher.
NOTE         "Frank Malloy has never known any life other than that of a cop, 
               but his newfound inheritance threatens his position within his 
               department. While trying to keep both his relationship with 
               Sarah and his fortune under wraps, he's assigned to a new
               case--finding a missing young woman for her worried father, 
               Henry Livingston. It seems the girl had been responding to 
               "lonely hearts" ads in the paper for months before she 
               disappeared. Her father thinks that she's eloped with a 
               deceptive stranger, but Malloy fears the worst, knowing that 
               the grifters who place such ads often do much more than simply 
               abscond with their victims. But as Sarah and Malloy delve 
               deeper into a twisted plot targeting the city's single women,

NOTE         This darkly festive tale of a yuletide ghoul reveals an 
               irreverently twisted side to the holiday. The horror-comedy 
               tells the story of young Max, who turns his back on Christmas 
               as his dysfunctional family comes together and comically 
               clashes over the holidays. When they accidentally unleash the 
               wrath of Krampus, an ancient entity from European folklore, all
               hell breaks loose and beloved holiday icons take on a monstrous
               life of their own.

               died unexpectedly after suffering from a mysterious disease. It
               is a tragic and all-too-common story or so it seems. Charles's 
               father asks to speak with Sarah privately. He believes his son 
               was poisoned and would like Sarah and Frank to look into the 
               matter with the utmost discretion. Putting their own personal 
               affairs on hold, Sarah and Frank soon learn that not everyone 
               wants to know more about Charles's death, particularly if he 
               was murdered. As they unravel secrets that reach back to the 
               War Between the States, they also discover that they are in the
               company of a very present danger"-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         "Former police sergeant Frank Malloy and his wife adjust to life 
               in New York high society as they investigate a death in the 
               field of higher learning. After spending his first few weeks as
               a private detective by investigating infidelities of the 
               wealthy, Frank has a more serious case at hand. Abigail 
               Northrup of Tarrytown, New York, was her parents' pride and
               joy. After graduating from a prestigious women's college in 
               Morningside Heights, she took a job there as an instructor. She
               also joined the ranks of the New Women, ladies planning for a 
               life without a husband in which they make their own decisions 
               and make a difference in the world. Unfortunately, her murder 
               ended all that. When the police declare the incident a random 
               attack and refuse to investigate further, Abigail's parents 
               request Frank's help. Of course, he'll need Sarah's assistance 
               as she's more familiar with the world of academia, and it will 
               be far easier for her to interview the lady professors. Yet 
               difficulties arise as they learn that although Miss Northrup 
               may have been an exemplary student and teacher, she lived in a 
               world of secrets and lies."-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         One night after an evening out, Jason Dessen, forty-year-old 
               physics professor living with his wife and son in Chicago, is 
               kidnapped at gunpoint by a masked man, driven to an abandoned 
               industrial site and injected with a powerful drug. As he wakes,
               a man Jason's never met smiles down at him and says, "Welcome 
               back, my friend." But this life is not the one he knows. His 
               wife is not his wife; his son was never born; and he's not an 
               ordinary college professor, but a celebrated genius who has 
               achieved something impossible. Is it this world or the other 
               that's the dream? How can he possibly make it back to the 
               family he loves? The answers lie in a journey more wondrous and
               horrifying than anything he could have imagined--one that will 
               force him to confront the darkest parts of himself as he 
               battles a terrifying, seemingly unbeatable foe. -- adapted from

               cracks of reality, Richard lands in the Neverwhere--a London of
               shadows and darkness, monsters and saints, murderers and angels
               that exists entirely in a subterranean labyrinth. The 
               Neverwhere is home to Door, the mysterious girl Richard helped 
               in the London Above. Door, a noblewoman whose family has been 
               murdered, is on a quest to find the agent that slaughtered her 
               family and thwart the destruction of this underworld kingdom. 
               If Richard is ever to return to his former life, he must join 
               the journey to save Door's world--and find a way to survive."--

               Reddy's suspicion that his task force is being stalked by an 
               unknown power bent on aiding the Grik for reasons of its own.

NOTE         As the United States raced against Russia to put a man in space, 
               NASA found untapped talent in a group of African-American 
               female mathematicians that served as the brains behind one of 
               the greatest operations in U.S. history.  Dorothy Vaughan, Mary
               Jackson, and Katherine Johnson crossed all gender, race, and 
               professional lines while their brilliance and desire to dream 
               big, beyond anything ever accomplished before by the human
               race, firmly cemented them in U.S. history as true American 
               heroes.

NOTE         "Taylor Anderson's enthralling New York Times bestselling series 
               of alternate history continues as game-changing revelations 
               upend the Grand Alliance in a potentially cataclysmic war. Ever
               since the USS Walker came from another world war to defy the 
               terrifying Grik and diabolical Dominion, Matt Reddy and his 
               crew have given their all to protect the oppressed Lemurians. 
               But with the Walker in desperate need of repairs just as the 
               Grik's First General is poised to strike, Reddy is desperate. 
               With more enemies than ever before arrayed against them, the 
               crew of the Walker needs new allies. That means combing the 
               lethal wilds of Madagascar to find the Lemurians' fabled 
               ancestors, as well as the enigmatic dwellers east of the Pass 
               of Fire. But what Reddy's crew unearths may be more than they 
               can handle--discoveries so shattering they could tilt the 
               balance of the war in either direction. But Reddy's greatest 
               adversary is from his past: a madman named Kurokawa whose 
               single-minded mission of revenge will shake the Alliance to its
               core and raise the stakes to the most personal and terrifying 
               levels Reddy has ever faced"-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         During the bloodiest battle of WWII, in Okinawa, Desmond Doss 
               saved 75 men without firing or carrying a gun. He was the only 
               American soldier in WWII to fight on the front lines without a 
               weapon, as he believed that while the war was justified, 
               killing was nevertheless wrong. As an army medic, he 
               singlehandedly evacuated the wounded from behind enemy lines, 
               braved fire while tending to soldiers and was wounded by a 
               grenade and hit by snipers. Doss was the first conscientious 
               objector to ever earn the Congressional Medal of Honor.

               as the conflict is about to become terrifyingly personal.... 
               Captain Matt Reddy and the crew of the USS Walker have been 
               fighting for their lives ever since their ship was swept from 
               the Pacific to another world and they became embroiled in a 
               deadly conflict between their Lemurian allies and the ravening 
               Grik. But things are about to get worse. With Reddy's family 
               and allies held prisoner by the mad General Kurokawa, the 
               mysterious League and evil Dominion plotting schemes of their 
               own, and the Grik trying to build their swarm and concentrate 
               power, Reddy faces danger on all sides. Although desperate to 
               confront Kurokawa, Captain Reddy fears he's subordinating the 
               war effort for personal reasons. But Kurokawa is too dangerous 
               to be left alone. With mighty League battleship Savoie at his 
               command, he plots a terrible vengeance against Reddy and his 
               tiny, battered destroyer. The stage is set for a terrible 
               cataclysm, and Reddy and his allies will have to risk 
               everything to protect what they hold dear"-- Provided by

NOTE         "Ireland, A.D. 671. It is the beginning of the summer season and 
               the Kingdom of Muman is preparing to celebrate the Great Fair 
               of Cashel. It is an extravagant nine days of contests, food, 
               and endless entertainment. Circumstances have led Fidelma and 
               Eadulf far and wide across the kingdom, and they have been 
               absent from the Great Fair for many years. But, for once they 
               haven't been called away from Cashel, and are eager to enjoy 
               the festivities - that is, until the last wagon in a group 
               traveling to the fair catches on fire. The driver dies and it 
               appears that the driver was a woman disguised a boy, for 
               reasons unknown. Eadulf, upon further inspection, finds an even
               more disconcerting discovery - a rotting corpse in back of the 
               wagon. Now, with only a week left to the fair, it is up to 
               Fidelma and Eadulf to solve the mystery in time"-- Provided by

               to debate the new religious rules that have been handed down

               which is hostile to the new rules from outsiders. Among the 
               Anglo-Saxon group is Brother Eadulf's own younger brother
               Egric, whom Eadulf hasn't seen for many years. When the debate 
               quickly becomes acrimonious, a local abbess has to step in as a
               mediator between the two sides. But not even a day later her 
               body is discovered, bludgeoned to death"--Dust jacket flap.

               expedition -- The death of Balder -- The last days of Loki -- 
               Ragnarok: The final destiny of the gods.
NOTE         Neil Gaiman stays true to the myths in envisioning the major 
               Norse pantheon: Odin, the highest of the high, wise, daring, 
               and cunning; Thor, Odin's son, incredibly strong yet not the 
               wisest of gods; and Loki, son of a giant, blood brother to
               Odin, and a trickster and unsurpassable manipulator. Gaiman 
               fashions these primeval stories into a novelistic arc that 
               begins with the genesis of the legendary nine worlds and delves
               into the exploits of deities, dwarfs, and giants. Once, when 
               Thor's hammer is stolen, Thor must disguise himself as a
               woman -- difficult with his beard and huge appetite -- to steal
               it back. More poignant is the tale in which the blood of Kvasir
               -- the most sagacious of gods -- is turned into a mead that 
               infuses drinkers with poetry. The work culminates in Ragnarok, 
               the twilight of the gods and rebirth of a new time and people.

NOTE         "It is August, 1645, one year since York fell into Puritan hands.
               As the city suffers through a brutal summer heat, Bridget 
               Hodgson and Martha Hawkins are drawn into a murder 
               investigation more frightening than their last. In order to 
               appease God's wrath--and end the heat-wave--the city's 
               overlords have launched a brutal campaign to whip the city's 
               sinners into godliness. But for someone in York, this is not 
               enough. First a prostitute and her client are found stabbed to 
               death, then a pair of adulterers are beaten and strangled.
               York's sinners have been targeted for execution. Bridget and 
               Martha--assisted once again by Will, Bridget's good-hearted 
               nephew--race to find the killer even as he adds more bodies to 
               his tally. The list of suspects is long: Hezekiah Ward, a fire 
               and brimstone preacher new to York; Ward's son, Praise-God, 
               whose intensity mirrors his father's; John Stubb, one of Ward's
               fanatic followers, whose taste for blood may not have been 
               sated by his time in Parliament's armies. Or could the killer 
               be closer to home? Will's brother Joseph is no stranger to 
               death, and he shares the Wards' dreams of driving sin from the 
               city. To find the killer, Bridget, Martha, and Will must 
               uncover the city's most secret sins, and hope against hope that
               the killer does not turn his attention in their direction"--

NOTE         "A vigorous, authoritative history of the last major battle 
               fought between Scottish and English forces, resulting in the 
               formation of the bedrock of the British Empire. The Battle of 
               Culloden in 1746 has gone down in history as the last major 
               battle fought on British soil: a vicious confrontation between 
               the English Royal Army and the Scottish forces supporting the 
               Stuart claim to the throne. But this wasn't just a conflict 
               between the Scots and the English: the battle was also part of 
               a much larger campaign to protect the British Isles from the 
               growing threat of a French invasion. In Trevor Royle's vivid 
               and evocative narrative, we are drawn into the ranks, on both 
               sides, alongside doomed Jacobites fighting fellow Scots dressed
               in the red coats of the Duke of Cumberland's Royal Army. And we
               meet the Duke himself, a skilled warrior who would gain 
               notoriety because of the reprisals on Highland clans in the 
               battle's aftermath. Royle also takes us beyond the battle as 
               the Royal Army, galvanized by its success at Culloden, expands 
               dramatically and start to fight campaigns overseas in America 
               and India in order to secure British interests. Culloden 
               changed the course of British history--by ending all hope of 
               the Stuarts reclaiming the throne and cementing Hanoverian rule
               to form the bedrock for the creation of the British Empire. 
               Royle's lively and provocative history looks afresh at the 
               period and unveils its true significance, not only as the end 
               of a struggle for the throne but the beginning of a new global 
               power."--Jacket.

NOTE         The turbulent Korean peninsula provides the backdrop to this fine
               military mystery, the fifth (after 2005's The Door to 
               Bitterness) to feature U.S. Army criminal investigation agents 
               George Sueño and Ernie Bascom. A crack combat unit stationed 
               near the strife-torn demilitarized zone proves strangely 
               uncooperative when a military policewoman disappears. The 
               missing soldier had made herself unpopular with her chain of 
               command when she attempted to testify against two GIs who 
               accidentally killed a Korean schoolgirl while speeding. As 
               Sueño and Bascom dig past the obfuscation, they uncover an 
               unsavory mix of black marketeering, sexual harassment, 
               corruption, rape and murder, risking disgrace in their quest to
               find their fellow cop before it's too late.

NOTE         ""Sam Thomas has created one of the most unique sleuths in modern
               mystery fiction." -The Plain Dealer. In this thrilling new 
               mystery from the critically acclaimed author of The Witch 
               Hunter's Tale, midwife Bridget Hodgson travels to London where 
               she's forced into a new profession-as a spy. It's 1649. Three 
               years have passed since midwife Bridget Hodgson and her deputy 
               Martha Hawkins fled York for the safety of the English 
               countryside. But when a mysterious letter from London brings 
               them to the capital, they are forced into service under 
               Jonathan Marlowe, Oliver Cromwell's chief spymaster. Reunited 
               with Bridget's nephew Will, the three seek out Parliament's 
               enemies even as the nation awaits the trial of the King on 
               charges of treason. Marlowe's first mission for Bridget is to 
               spy upon Katherine Chidley, a notorious political radical and-
               Marlowe fears-a potential rebel against Parliament. The more 
               time Bridget spends with Katherine, however, the closer the two
               become, and when Katherine's husband Daniel is murdered, 
               Bridget and Martha join in the search for the killer. As the 
               two uncover Daniel's secrets, the list of suspects grows ever 
               longer, until it includes royalists, radicals, and a figure 
               from Bridget's past, who is equal parts mysterious and deadly. 
               When the killer strikes again, Bridget and Martha realize that 
               he is bent on far more than mere murder, but intends to revive 
               the civil wars or destroy England entirely"-- Provided by

NOTE         When the Bailey family moves into an army base in Virginia there 
               are a lot of adjustments to make; twelve-year-old Tom runs 
               afoul of the base school bully, ten-year-old Charlotte finds 
               herself trying too hard to make friends with the "cool" girls, 
               and six-year-old Rosie is just being difficult as usual--but 
               they come together to investigate a mysterious building full of
               weird cages, and uncover Fort Patrick's secrets.

PUB INFO     Boston : Orbit, 2012.
DESCRIPT     p. cm.
NOTE         The undead matriarch of a Britain where the Aristocracy is made 
               up of werewolves and vampires, where goblins live underground 
               and mothers know better than to let their children out after 
               dark. A world where being nobility means being infected with 
               the Plague (side-effects include undeath), Hysteria is the 
               popular affliction of the day, and leeches are considered a 
               delicacy. And a world where technology lives side by side with 
               magic. The year is 2012 and Pax Britannia still reigns. Xandra 
               Vardan is a member of the elite Royal Guard, and it is her duty
               to protect the Aristocracy. But when her sister goes missing, 
               Xandra will set out on a path that undermines everything she 
               believed in and uncover a conspiracy that threatens to topple 
               the empire. And she is the key-the prize in a very dangerous 
               struggle.

               scrutiny of Queen Victoria, who for some reason wants her head.
               Not to mention her werewolf boyfriend with demands of his own, 
               and a mother hell-bent on destroying the monarchy. Now she's 
               the suspect in a murder investigation--and Xandra barely knows 
               which way is up. What she does know is that nothing lasts 
               forever--and immortality isn't all it's cracked up to be."--

NOTE         "The bloodthirsty Jit is dead, and against all odds Richard and 
               Kahlan have survived. But a new menace has attacked them in the
               Dark Lands. Infected with the essence of death itself, robbed 
               of his power as a war wizard, Richard must race against time to
               uncover and stop the infernal conspiracy assembling itself 
               behind the wall far to the north. His friends and allies are 
               already captives of this fell combination, and Kahlan, also 
               touched by death's power, will die completely if Richard fails.
               Bereft of magic, Richard has only his sword, his wits, his 
               capacity for insight -- and an extraordinary companion, the 
               young Samantha, a healer just coming into her powers. 
               Compelling, fast-moving, and intense, The Third Kingdom is a 
               powerful tale that welcomes new readers to Terry Goodkind's 
               world, while opening up new vistas of worldbuilding for 
               longtime readers of the adventures of Richard Rahl and Kahlan

               humans--wants the goblins on their side, because whoever has 
               the goblins--wins. Queen Victoria wants her head, Alpha wolf 
               Vex wants her heart, and she still doesn't know the identity of
               the person who wanted her blood. What she does know is that a 
               project from one of the 'secret' aristocrat labs has gotten 
               free and she's the only one who can stop the perfect killing 
               machine--a sixteen year-old girl. With human zealots intent on 
               ridding the world of anyone with plagued blood and supernatural
               politics taking Britain to the verge of civil war, Xandra's 
               finding out that being queen isn't all it's cracked up to be, 
               and if she doesn't do something fast, hers will be the shortest

               to the resort in an attempt to steal the diamond and blame it 
               on 'The Phantom,' not knowing that it's his uncle. Hot on the 
               Phantom's trail is Inspector Jacques Clouseau. His wife is the 
               lover of Charles and helps in the Phantom's crimes. Jacques 
               tries to stop the attempts, but he is completely clueless. When
               several attempts are made at a dress formal party, Jacques 
               looks everywhere but the right place.

NOTE         The pair of G.I. cops Martin Limon first introduced in Jade Lady 
               Burning (a New York Times Notable Book of the Year) are back 
               with a vengeance in their latest adventures in Seoul and the 
               sin cities surrounding the capital in the 1970s. North Korea is
               menacing, Vietnam is burning as these two weave through the 
               back alleys and bordellos, as they try to tip back the scales 
               of justice in the right direction. This time they are not only 
               pursuing criminals, they're chasing themselves in a way, too. 
               Homicidal thieves have gotten hold of Sueno's badge, and are 
               using it to lull their victims just long enough to strike-with 
               his gun. That they are murderous makes it all that much worse 
               for the dynamic duo. The army wants its equipment accounted
               for, the I.D. and weapon recovered. George and Ernie want to 
               recover their reputation and catch the culprits.

               scions of the house of Canarn, face fugitive exile or death. In
               the court of Ro Tiris, men fear to speak their minds. The Army 
               of the Red marches upon the North. Strange accidents befall 
               those who dare question the King's new advisors. Those foolish 
               enough to speak their names call them the Seven Sisters: 
               witches of the fire god; each as beautiful and as dangerous as 
               a flame. And, called from the long ages of deep time by war and
               sacrifice, the children of a dead god are waking with a 
               pitiless cry. All that was dead will rise. All that now lives

SERIES       Limón, Martin, 1948- Sergeants Sueño & Bascom mystery.
NOTE         On a crowded train from Pusan to Seoul, the brutal rape of a 
               young mother sparks rage on the powder-keg peninsula of Korea, 
               pitting Koreans against Americans and the 8th Army brass 
               against the truth. Eyewitness accounts indicate the culprit was
               most likely a U.S. serviceman, but by the time Sergeants George
               Sueno and Ernie Bascom, U.S. Army investigators, are called in,
               the rapist has disappeared and anti-American fervor in this 
               proud Asian country is threatening to explode. George and Ernie
               search in vain for the culprit, all the while becoming 
               entangled in the web of military apologists who deny that any 
               Americans were involved, and the designs of a beautiful blonde 
               musician who fronts an all-female country western band. Delay 
               causes more tragedy--and this time murder--and sets off a 
               frantic search for a killer that stretches from the sizzling 
               hot Demilitarized Zone to the cold waters of the Yellow Sea and
               introduces George Sueno and Ernie Bascom to a ruthless Korean 
               homicide investigator known to anyone foolish enough to cross 
               him as Mr. Kill.

NOTE         "An explosive expose of the right's relentless campaign to 
               eliminate unions, suppress voting, privatize public education, 
               and change the Constitution. "Perhaps the best explanation to 
               date of the roots of the political divide that threatens to 
               irrevocably alter American government." --Booklist (starred 
               review) Behind today's headlines of billionaires taking over 
               our government is a secretive political establishment with
               long, deep, and troubling roots. The capitalist radical right 
               has been working not simply to change who rules, but to 
               fundamentally alter the rules of democratic governance. But 
               billionaires did not launch this movement; a white intellectual
               in the embattled Jim Crow South did. Democracy in Chains names 
               its true architect--the Nobel Prize-winning political economist
               James McGill Buchanan--and dissects the operation he and his 
               colleagues designed over six decades to alter every branch of 
               government to disempower the majority. In a brilliant and 
               engrossing narrative, Nancy MacLean shows how Buchanan forged 
               his ideas about government in a last gasp attempt to preserve 
               the white elite's power in the wake of Brown v. Board of 
               Education. In response to the widening of American democracy, 
               he developed a brilliant, if diabolical, plan to undermine the 
               ability of the majority to use its numbers to level the playing
               field between the rich and powerful and the rest of us. 
               Corporate donors and their right-wing foundations were only too
               eager to support Buchanan's work in teaching others how to 
               divide America into "makers" and "takers." And when a 
               multibillionaire on a messianic mission to rewrite the social 
               contract of the modern world, Charles Koch, discovered
               Buchanan, he created a vast, relentless, and multi-armed 
               machine to carry out Buchanan's strategy. Without Buchanan's 
               ideas and Koch's money, the libertarian right would not have 
               succeeded in its stealth takeover of the Republican Party as a 
               delivery mechanism. Now, with Mike Pence as Vice President, the
               cause has a longtime loyalist in the White House, not to 
               mention a phalanx of Republicans in the House, the Senate, a 
               majority of state governments, and the courts, all carrying out
               the plan. That plan includes harsher laws to undermine unions, 
               privatizing everything from schools to health care and Social 
               Security, and keeping as many of us as possible from voting. 
               Based on ten years of unique research, Democracy in Chains 
               tells a chilling story of right-wing academics and big money 
               run amok. This revelatory work of scholarship is also a call to
               arms to protect the achievements of twentieth-century American 
               self-government"-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         1390. Hailes Abbey, Gloucestershire, England. Two monks lie 
               murdered, their Holy Blood relic stolen: a relic that is said 
               to run liquid for the sinless and remain stubbornly dry for the
               sinner. Unwilling to become involved in a bitter dispute 
               between a country monastery and Westminster Abbey, the 
               disgraced former knight Crispin Guest attempts to return the 
               relic to Hailes where it belongs, but somehow it keeps 
               returning to his hands no matter what. As he tries to shield a 
               former nemesis from a charge of murder while becoming entangled
               with a mysterious and beautiful woman caught between Church 
               politics and the dangerous intrigues of King Richard?s court, 
               Crispin begins to suspect that someone at Westminster is 
               conspiring with the assassins. Can the Blood of Christ point to
               the killer?

NOTE         "South Korea, 1974. CID Sergeants George Suen⁺³o and Ernie Bascom
               are assigned an underwhelming case of petty theft: Major 
               Frederick M. Schulz has accused Miss Jo Kyong-Ja, an Itaewon 
               bar girl, of stealing a hundred thousand won from him--a sum 
               equaling less than fifty US dollars. After two very divergent 
               accounts of what happened, Miss Jo is attacked in the night, 
               and Schulz is found hacked to death only days later. Did 
               tensions simply escalate to the point of murder? Looking into 
               other motives for Schulz's death, George and Ernie discover 
               that he was investigating the 501st Military Intelligence 
               Battalion: the Army's counterintelligence arm, dedicated solely
               to tracking North Korean spies. The division is rife with 
               suspects, but it's dangerous to speak out against them in a 
               period of Cold War finger-pointing. While they're used to 
               breaking 8th Army rules, as George and Ernie go head-to-head 
               with the powerful, intimidating Captain Lance Blood, they learn
               that messing with the 501st can have very personal
               consequences"-- Provided by publisher.

               a woman. George suspects that the woman is no mythical

PUB INFO     New York : Simon & Schuster, c2005.
DESCRIPT     386 p. : ill. (some col.), col. maps ; 25 cm.
NOTE         Includes bibliographical references (p. 347-371) and index.

NOTE         Based on extensive research in both American and British
               archives, 1776 is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of 
               every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, 
               shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it 
               is the story of the British commander, William Howe, and his 
               highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with
               contempt and fought with a valor too little known. But it is 
               the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost -- 
               Washington, who had never before led an army in battle.

SERIES       The Lovecraft Squad ; 1.
NOTE         There has always been something wrong about All Hallows Church. 
               Not just the building, but the very land upon it stands. 
               Reports dating back to Roman times reveal that it has always 
               been a bad place--blighted by strange sightings, unusual 
               phenomena, and unexplained disappearances. So in the 1990s, a 
               team of para-psychiatrists is sent in to investigate the 
               various mysteries surrounding the Church and its unsavoury 
               legends. From the start, they begin to discover a paranormal 
               world that defies belief. But as they dig deeper, not only do 
               they uncover some of the secrets behind the ancient edifice 
               designed by "Zombie King" Thomas Moreby but, hidden away 
               beneath everything else, something so ancient and so terrifying
               that it is using the architect himself as a conduit to 
               unimaginable evil. After four days and nights, not everybody 
               survives--and those that do will come to wish they hadn't.

NOTE         "In a time of revolution, everyone -- even a humble seamstress 
               plying her magic to support her family -- must take a side. 
               Sophie is a young dressmaker who, with hard work, talent, and a
               rare proficiency sewing spells into cloth, has managed to open 
               her own shop and lift herself and her brother, Kristos, out of 
               the poverty that plagues their immigrant community. Her 
               reputation for beautiful ballgowns and discreetly-embroidered 
               charms for luck, love, and protection secures her a commission 
               from the royal family itself -- and the commission earns her 
               the attentions of a dashing but entirely unattainable duke. 
               Meanwhile, her brother, a day laborer with a keen mind and a 
               thirst for justice, rises to prominence in the growing anti-
               monarchist movement. Their worlds collide when the revolution's
               shadow leader takes Kristos hostage and demands that Sophie 
               place a curse on the queen's new Midwinter costume -- or 
               Kristos will die at their hand. As the proletariat uprising 
               comes to a violent climax, Sophie must choose: between her 
               brother and the community of her birth, and her lover and the 
               life she's striven to build. Torn is the first novel in an 
               enchanting new fantasy series"-- Provided by publisher.

               dinosaurs predominate, and they are the weapons of choice. Vast
               armies of dinosaur-mounted knights engage in battle. During the
               course of one of these epic battles, the enigmatic mercenary 
               Dinosaur Lord Karyl Bogomirsky is defeated through betrayal and
               left for dead. He wakes, naked, wounded, partially amnesiac-and
               hunted. And embarks upon a journey that will shake his world.

               the end of the USS Walker. Ever since their ship was 
               transported to another world, and they became embroiled in a 
               deadly conflict between the Lemurians and the vicious Grik, the
               Walker has been taking a pounding. With Walker out of 
               commission for repairs, Reddy takes command of a different ship
               and joins a desperate battle to block the Grik swarm.
               Meanwhile, the humans and their allies face a deadly second

TITLE        Fresh off the boat : a memoir / Eddie Huang.
EDITION      1st ed.
PUB INFO     New York : Spiegel & Grau, c2013.
DESCRIPT     276 p. ; 25 cm.
NOTE         The author is the thirty-year-old proprietor of Baohaus, the hot 
               East Village hangout where foodies, stoners, and students come 
               to stuff their faces with delicious Taiwanese street food late 
               into the night, and one of the food world's brightest and most 
               controversial young stars. But before he created the perfect 
               home for himself in a small patch of downtown New York, he 
               wandered the American wilderness looking for a place to call 
               his own. He grew up in theme-park America, on a could-be-
               anywhere cul-de-sac in suburban Orlando, Florida raised by a 
               wild family of FOB ("fresh off the boat") hustlers and 
               hysterics from Taiwan. While his father improbably launched a 
               series of successful seafood and steak restaurants, the author 
               burned his way through American culture, defying every "model 
               minority" stereotype along the way. He obsessed over football, 
               fought the all-American boys who called him a chink, partied 
               like a gremlin, sold drugs with his crew, and idolized Tupac. 
               His anchor through it all was food, from making Southern ribs 
               with the Haitian cooks in his dad's restaurant to preparing 
               traditional meals in his mother's kitchen to haunting the 
               midnight markets of Taipei when he was shipped off to the 
               homeland. After misadventures as an unlikely lawyer, street 
               fashion renegade, and stand-up comic, he finally threw 
               everything he loved, past and present, family and food, into 
               his own restaurant, bringing together a legacy stretching back 
               to China and the shards of global culture he had melded into 
               his own identity. This book is the immigrant's story for the 
               twenty-first century; a story of food, family, and the forging 
               of a new notion of what it means to be an American.

NOTE         "A crackling, highly imaginative thriller debut in the vein of 
               W.E.B. Griffin and Philip Kerr, set in German-occupied London 
               at the close of World War II, in which a hardened British 
               detective jeopardizes his own life to save an innocent soul and
               achieve the impossible--redemption. London, 1946. The Nazis 
               have conquered the British, and now occupy Great Britain, using
               brutality and fear to control its citizens. John Henry Rossett,
               a decorated British war hero and former police sergeant, has 
               been reassigned to the Office of Jewish Affairs. He now answers
               to the SS, one of the most powerful and terrifying 
               organizations in the Third Reich. Rossett is a man accustomed 
               to obeying commands, but he's now assigned a job he did not ask
               for--and cannot refuse: rounding up Jews for deportation, 
               including men and women he's known his whole life. But they are
               not the only victims, for the war took Rossett's wife and son, 
               and shattered his own humanity. Then he finds Jacob, a young 
               Jewish child, hiding in an abandoned building, who touches 
               something in Rossett that he thought was long dead. Determined 
               to save the innocent boy, Rossett takes him on the run, with 
               the Nazis in pursuit. But they are not the only hunters 
               following his trail. The Royalist Resistance and the Communists
               want him, too. Each faction has its own agenda, and Rossett 
               will soon learn that none of them can be trusted. and all of 
               them are deadly."-- Provided by publisher.
NOTE         "The terrible struggle that was WWII is over, the Germans have 
               won and now occupy London, but it's up to a hardened British 
               detective to turn the tables, save someone's life, and achieve

NOTE         After years of struggle, the Foundation lies in ruins - destroyed
               by the mutant mind power of the Mule. But is has been rumored 
               that there is a Second Foundation hidden somewhere at the end 
               of the Galaxy, established as insurance to preserve the 
               knowledge of mankind through the long centuries of barbarism. 
               The Mule failed to find it the first time - but now he is 
               certain he know where it is. And this time the annihilation 
               will be total: no trace of humanity's shining past - or its 
               future hope - will remain. The fate of the Foundation rests on 
               young Areadia Darell, only fourteen years old and burdened with
               a terrible secret. Is she the Foundation's savior - or its 
               deadliest enemy? A warrior of humanity's light - or a weapon 
               whose every thought and action could be turned against them in 
               an instant? Now, as its scientists gird for a final showdown 
               with the Mule, the survivors of the First Foundation begin 
               their desperate search across the Galaxy in a race against the 
               alien entity. They, too, want it destroyed... before it 
               destroys them.

NOTE         "The formidable sorceress Nicci and her companions--the newly 
               powerless Nathan and the youthful Bannon--set out on another 
               quest after driving ruthless Norukai slavers out of Renda Bay. 
               Their mission: restore Nathan's magic and, for Nicci, save the 
               world. Guided by the witch-woman Red's mysterious prophecy, the
               trio makes their way south of Kol Adair toward a wondrous city 
               shrouded behind time, Ildakar. But the grotesque omens on their
               path to Nathan's salvation--severed Norukai heads on pikes, a 
               genetically modified monster, and a petrified army of half a 
               million--are just a taste of the unimaginable horrors that 
               await within the Shroud of Eternity" -- Dust jacket.

NOTE         "An exciting new series featuring woman-on-the-run Elizabeth 
               Miles--from the beloved national bestselling author of the 
               Gaslight Mysteries. Every woman plays a part--but some are more
               dangerous than others...Like most women, Elizabeth Miles 
               assumes many roles; unlike most, hers have made her a woman on 
               the run. Living on the edge of society, Elizabeth uses her 
               guile to relieve so-called respectable men of their ill-gotten 
               gains. But brutal and greedy entrepreneur Oscar Thornton is out
               for blood. He's lost a great deal of money and is not going to 
               forgive a woman for outwitting him. With his thugs hot on her 
               trail, Elizabeth seizes the moment to blend in with a group of 
               women who have an agenda of their own. She never expects to 
               like or understand these privileged women, but she soon comes 
               to respect their intentions, forming an unlikely bond with the 
               wealthy matriarch of the group whose son, Gideon, is the rarest
               of species--an honest man in a dishonest world. Elizabeth knows
               she's playing a risky game, and her deception could be revealed
               at any moment, possibly even by sharp-eyed Gideon. Nor has she 
               been forgotten by Thornton, who's biding his time, waiting to 
               strike. Elizabeth must draw on her wits and every last ounce of
               courage she possesses to keep her new life from being cut short
               by this vicious shadow from her past"-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         This new translation of the Chinese classic and foundation text

               years, introducing a fundamentally different view of the nature
               of the Dao. Michael Puett, the Walter C. Klein Professor of 
               Chinese History and Chair of the Committee on the Study of 
               Religion at Harvard University, calls this translation "an 
               excellent translation of one of the most important texts from 
               the Chinese philosophical tradition," and goes on to state: 
               "Building upon the crucial body of scholarship that has 
               developed in China over the past several decades, Yang Peng 
               succeeds in providing a translation that is both precise and 
               readable. A wonderful achievement!" --Publisher.

NOTE         "The ramifications of Shroud of Eternity extends throughout all 
               of the Old World as familiar allies, dangerous magic, and 
               creatures created by twisted sorcery all work at cross purposes
               to either save or destroy Ildakar in Terry Goodkind's Siege of 
               Stone. The Sorceress Nicci, the Wizard Nathan Rahl, and the 
               young swordsman Bannon remain in the legendary city of Ildakar 
               after a great internal revolt has freed the slaves and brought 
               down the powerful wizards council. But as he fled the city, 
               capricious Wizard Commander Maxim dissolved the petrification 
               spell that had turned to stone the invading army of General 
               Utros fifteen centuries earlier. Now hundreds of thousands of 
               half-stone soldiers from the ancient past have awakened, led by
               one of the greatest enemy commanders in history. Nicci, Nathan,
               and Bannon have to help Ildakar survive this unbreakable siege,
               using all the magical defenses of the legendary city. Even as 
               General Utros holds Ildakar hostage and also unleashes his 
               incredible army on the unsuspecting Old World, an equally 
               powerful threat arises out in the sea. Nicci knows the battle 
               won't remain in the city; if she can't stop this threat, two 
               invincible armies can sweep across the Old World and destroy 
               D'Hara itself" -- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         "The Iceman is an action-packed World War II military thriller 
               featuring a daring United States Navy submarine commander 
               during the Pacific war in 1942-43. In 1942, off the port city 
               of St. Nazaire in occupied France, a United States Navy S-class
               submarine assigned to the Royal Navy lurks just outside the 
               borders of the minefield protecting a German U-boat base. 
               Lieutenant Commander Malachi Stormes, the boat's skipper, 
               patrols dangerously close to the minefield entrance and manages
               to trap and sink three outbound U-boats in one spectacular 
               attack. Britain decorates him, the U.S. Navy promotes him and 
               then gives him command of a brand new class of submarine, a 
               fleet boat called Firefish. Based in Perth, Australia, having 
               been driven out of the Philippines by the Japanese juggernaut, 
               the Perth boats are the only American forces capable of hitting
               the Japanese in the western Pacific. Stormes, with his cold, 
               steely-eyed focus on killing Japanese ships, is an enigma to 
               his officers and crew, especially when it becomes clear that he
               is willing to take huge chances to achieve results. Firefish 
               sinks more ships than any Perth boat on her first war patrol, 
               but Stormes' unconventional tactics literally frighten his
               crew. Driven by a past steeped in the whiskey-haunted violence 
               of the Kentucky coal fields, whose psychological scars torment 
               his sleep and close him off from personal relationships, 
               Stormes is nicknamed The Iceman. His crew is proud of their 
               boat's accomplishments, but wonder if their iron-willed skipper
               will bring them home alive. With intense action and featuring 
               authentic submarine tactics in the early years of the Pacific 
               war, The Iceman continues P. T. Deutermann's masterful, award-
               winning cycle of thrillers set during World War II"-- Provided

NOTE         "Ashok Vidal was once a member of the highest caste in all of Lok
               whose life was devoted to upholding the Law, delivering swift 
               justice with his ancestor blade Angruvadal. Until the day he 
               learned his entire life to that point was a lie. Now one of the
               casteless, he began a campaign of rebellion, war and 
               destruction. Thera had been a member of the Warrior Order, 
               spending her life training for combat until she was struck by 
               lightning gaining the power to see the future. She fought 
               alongside Ashok and his company of men know as the Sons of the 
               Black Sword until a shapeshifting wizard with designs on her 
               powers of precognition spirited her away. He holds her prisoner
               in the House of Assassins. Ashok and his men march to the 
               rescue. With his sword Angruvadal, he was unstoppable. But 
               Angruvadal is gone, shattered defeating a demon. Now Ashok must
               fight without the aid of the magic blace for the first time. 
               Thera's life depends on it"-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         "After the War of the Gods, the demons were cast out and fell to 
               the world. Mankind was nearly eradicated by the seemingly 
               unstoppable beasts, until the gods sent the great hero, 
               Ramrowan, to save them. He united the tribes, gave them magic, 
               and drove the demons into the sea. Ever since the land has 
               belonged to man and the oceans have remained an uncrossable 
               hell, leaving the continent of Lok isolated. It was prophesized
               that someday the demons would return, and only the descendants 
               of Ramrowan would be able to defeat them. They became the first
               kings, and all men served those who were their only hope for 
               survival. As centuries passed the descendants of the great hero
               grew in number and power. They became tyrannical and cruel, and
               their religion nothing but an excuse for greed. Gods and demons
               became myth and legend, and the people no longer believed. The 
               castes created to serve the Sons of Ramrowan rose up and 
               destroyed their rulers. All religion was banned and replaced by
               a code of unflinching law. The surviving royalty and their 
               priests were made casteless, condemned to live as untouchables,
               and the Age of Law began. Ashok Vadal has been chosen by a 
               powerful ancient weapon to be its bearer. He is a Protector, 
               the elite militant order of roving law enforcers. No one is 
               more merciless in rooting out those who secretly practice the 
               old ways. Everything is black or white, good or evil, until he 
               discovers his entire life is a fraud. Ashok isn't who he thinks
               he is, and when he finds himself on the wrong side of the law, 
               the consequences lead to rebellion, war--and destruction"--

NOTE         Burnett and Evans believe that in order to change, people need a 
               process-- a design process-- to help them figure out what they 
               want and how to create it. Rather than dreaming up a lot of fun
               fantasies that have no relationship to the real world-- or the 
               real you-- they show us how to build a future brick by brick, 
               how to approach our own life design challenges with curiosity 
               and creativity. They give us the tools and show us certain 
               simple "mind-sets," and how to use them to practice life design
               in your life.

NOTE         Visible in the night sky, the Argus Station, its twin smelting 
               plants like glowing eyes, looks down on nightmare Earth. From 
               Argus, the Committee keep an oppressive control: citizens are 
               watched by cams systems and political officers, it's a world 
               inhabited by shepherds, reader guns, razor birds and the brutal
               Inspectorate with its white tiled cells and pain inducers. Soon
               the Committee will have the power to edit human minds, but not 
               yet, as twelve billion human beings need to die before Earth 
               can be stabilized, but by turning large portions of Earth into 
               concentration camps this is achievable, especially when the 
               Argus satellite laser network comes fully online.

NOTE         Thanks to Alan Saul, the Committee's network of control is a 
               smoking ruin and its robotic enforcers lie dormant. But power 
               abhors a vacuum and, scrambling from the wreckage, comes the 
               ruthless Serene Galahad. She must act while the last vestiges 
               of Committee infrastructure remain intact-- and she has the 
               means to ensure command is hers. On Mars, Var Delex fights for 
               the survival of Antares Base, while the Argus Space Station 
               hurls towards the red planet. And she knows whomever, or 
               whatever, trashed Earth is still aboard. And aboard Argus 
               Station, Alan Saul's mind has expanded into the local computer 
               network. In the process, he uncovers the ghastly experiments of
               the Humanoid Unit Development, the possibility of eternal life,
               and a madman who may hold the keys to interstellar flight.

NOTE         When Aoelyn loses her parents, she is left to fend for herself 
               among a tribe of vicious barbarians. Bound by rigid traditions,
               she dreams of escaping to the world beyond her mountain home. 
               The only hope for achieving the kind of freedom she searches 
               for is to learn how to wield the mysterious power used by the 
               tribe's coven known as the Song of Usgar. Thankfully, Aoelyn 
               may be the strongest witch to have ever lived, but magic comes 
               at price. Not only has her abilities caught the eye of the 
               brutish warlord that leads the tribe, but the demon of the 
               mountain hunts all who wield the Coven's power, and Aoelyn's 
               talent has made her a beacon in the night.

NOTE         Previously published in 2013 by Tor.
NOTE         "Trapped on the surface of Mars, Saul and his sister Var must 
               find a way to return to Argus Station, but the new base 
               commander, Rhone, stands in their way. Saul wants to pursue his
               dreams, turning the Argus Station into an interstellar vessel, 
               rebuilding it with weapons, and leaving the solar system. 
               Meanwhile, Alex, the clone of Alessandro Messina, watches those
               around him change as they become 'chipped' and able to control 
               station robots. Immortality lies within their grasp, yet 
               rebellion is brewing, and Alex's old bloody skills might be 
               required. Injured and dying aboard the Scourge, after its brush
               with Argus Station's warp field, Captain Scotonis is determined
               to have his revenge on Serene Galahad for killing his family 
               with the Scour. Clay Ruger, however, is equally as determined 
               to survive. Perhaps the gene bank data aboard can be used to 
               buy a pardon and, perhaps, someone else more murderous that him
               has chosen [than] course. Bitter at allowing Saul to escape her
               grasp, Serene Galahad wreaks her vengeance on her tacticians, 
               but it is not enough and she needs to be where the action is. 
               In the Mars Traveller construction station in Earth orbit 
               Professor Calder is building the ships that might be able to 
               catch Saul, and the weapons to stop him."--Author's web page.

               occupied town, but they do not realize what kind of a time they
               are in for. Not only is their mission dangerous by conventional
               means, but it has a supernatural element to it that makes their
               blood run cold. Can they successfully thwart the plot unfolding
               in front of them, or are they doomed to be unwitting guinea 
               pigs in a sick experiment by the Aryan race?

NOTE         "Dorian Robert-Houdin, the three-and-a-half-foot gargoyle chef 
               who fancies himself a modern-day Poirot, is slowly turning into
               stone, and it's up to Zoe Faust to unravel the alchemical 
               secrets that can save him. When they discover that a long-lost 
               stone gargoyle with a connection to Dorian has reappeared in 
               Europe, the stakes are even higher. From Portland to Paris, Zoe
               searches for the hidden knowledge she needs, but a cold case 
               that harkens back to 1942 throws her off course. With an ailing
               friend desperately trying to discover his own Elixir of Life 
               and a new romantic interest offering the first chance at love 
               she's had in nearly a century, Zoe is torn between a dangerous 
               form of alchemy and her desire for a normal life."--Amazon.com.

               in the Oregon wilderness. Four years later, in the midst of his
               Great sadness, Mack receives a suspicious note, apparently from
               God, inviting him back to that shack for a weekend. Against his
               better judgment he arrives at the shack on a wintry afternoon 
               and walks back into the darkest nightmare. what he finds there 
               will change Mack's world forever. In a world where religion 
               seems to grow increasingly irrelevant, the shack wrestles with 
               the timeless question: Where is God in a world so filled with 
               unspeakable pain? the answers Mack gets will astound you and 
               perhaps transform you as much as it did him.

NOTE         A primordial world with every species of dinosaur, large and 
               small. And humans, who were brought to this world on the whim 
               of the gods. Knights ride into battle on Triceratops; their 
               heroes lead them on T-Rexes. Karyl Bogomirskiy is one such
               hero. Once, he held power. Betrayed by those closest to him, he
               was resurrected by the Fae, magical beings native to the world,
               who seek to use him in their eternal battle against alien gods.
               Karyl just wants to be left in peace, reluctant to be anyone's 
               tool, much less a savior. But the gods have returned to judge 
               their human experiment and to finally rid the planet of the
               Fae. And while Karyl doesn't feel like a hero, he's last best 
               hope of humanity.

SERIES       Pandian, Gigi, 1975- Jaya Jones treasure hunt mystery series ;
               no. 5.
NOTE         A fabled illusion performed by a stage magician who claims to 
               possess real supernatural powers. A treasure from the colonial 
               era in India when international supremacies vied for power. A 
               phantom trading ship lost over 200 years ago. And a ninja whose
               murderous intentions in present-day Japan connect the deeds of 
               a long-dead trader who was much more than he seemed ... When 
               Jaya travels from San Francisco to Japan with her stage 
               magician best friend Sanjay--a.k.a. The Hindi Houdini--for his 
               Japanese debut, she jumps at the chance to pursue her own 
               research that could solve a tantalizing centuries-old mystery. 
               With the colorful autumn leaves of historic Kyoto falling 
               around her, Jaya soon loses sight of what's real and what's a 
               deception. A mysterious ninja attempts sabotage on Sanjay's 
               trick, along with Japan's most controversial magician, Akira. 
               Ancient folklore blurs the lines between illusion and reality 
               when a magician's assistant appears to be a kitsune, a mythical
               fox spirit. As tricks escalate to murder, Jaya and her friends 
               must unravel secrets hidden in the ancient capital of Japan, 
               before one of their own becomes the next victim.

SERIES       Asher, Neal L., 1961- Transformation ; bk. 1.
NOTE         Thorvald Spear wakes in a hospital to find he’s been resurrected,
               having died in a human-versus-alien war that ended a century 
               earlier. Penny Royal, the AI sent to save a group of besieged 
               human soldiers, turned rogue and annihilated friendly forces, 
               including Spear, in a frenzy of destruction and killing. One 
               hundred years later the AI is still on the loose, and the 
               reanimated Spear vows for revenge at any cost. Isobel Satomi 
               ran a successful crime syndicate, but after competitors 
               attacked, she needed power and protection. Negotiating with 
               Penny Royal, she got more than she bargained for: turning part-
               AI herself gave Isobel frightening power, but the upgrades hid 
               a horrifying secret, and Penny Royal triggered a transformation
               that has been turning her into something far from human . . . 
               Spear hires Isobel to track Penny Royal across the galaxy to 
               its last known whereabouts, but their alliance may only be one 
               of convenience. As Isobel continues to evolve into something 
               monstrous, it’s clear her rage will eventually win out over 
               reason. Will Spear finish his hunt before he himself becomes 
               the hunted? Dark Intelligence is the explosive first novel in a
               brand-new trilogy from military SF master Neal Asher and a new 
               chapter in his epic Polity universe.

NOTE         "Thorvald Spear, resurrected from his death over a hundred years 
               earlier, continues to hunt Penny Royal, the rogue AI and 
               dangerous war criminal on the run from Polity forces. Beyond 
               the Graveyard, a lawless and deadly area in deep space, Spear 
               follows the trail of several enemy Prador, the crab-like alien 
               species with a violent history of conflict with humanity.
               Sverl, a Prador genetically modified by Penny Royal and slowly 
               becoming human, pursues Cvorn, a Prador harboring deep hatred 
               for the Polity looking to use him and other hybrids to reignite
               the dormant war with mankind. Blite, captain of a bounty 
               hunting ship, hands over two prisoners and valuable memplants 
               from Penny Royal to the Brockle, a dangerous forensics entity 
               under strict confinement on a Polity spaceship that quickly 
               takes a keen interest in the corrupted AI and its unclear 
               motives. Penny Royal meanwhile continues to pull all the 
               strings in the background, keeping the Polity at bay and 
               seizing control of an attack ship. It seeks Factory Station 
               Room 101, a wartime manufacturing space station believed to be 
               destroyed. What does it want with the factory? And will Spear 
               find the rogue AI before it gets there?"-- Provided by

NOTE         "In the outskirts of space, and the far corners of the Polity, 
               complex dealings are in play. Several forces continue to pursue
               the deadly and enigmatic Penny Royal, none more dangerous than 
               the Brockle, a psychopathic forensics AI and criminal who has 
               escaped the Polity's confinements and is upgrading itself in 
               anticipation of a deadly showdown, becoming ever more powerful 
               and intelligent. Aboard Factory Station Room 101, the behemoth 
               war factory that birthed Penny Royal, groups of humans, alien 
               prador, and AI war drones grapple for control. The stability of
               the ship is complicated by the arrival of a gabbleduck known as
               the Weaver, the last living member of the ancient and powerful 
               Atheter alien race. What would an Atheter want with the 
               complicated dealings of Penny Royal? Are the Polity and prador 
               forces playing right into the dark AI's hand, or is it the 
               other way around? Set pieces align in the final book of Neal 
               Asher's action-packed Transformation trilogy, pointing to a 
               showdown on the cusp of the Layden's Sink black hole, inside of
               which lies a powerful secret, one that could destroy the entire
               Polity"-- Provided by publisher.

               up defining the rest of his life. Of course, it's not a normal 
               day in Billy's life either. Facing off with Sheriff Pat
               Garrett, Billy will soon discover whether or not he can live up
               to his own bold legend.

TITLE        Ironskin / Tina Connolly.
EDITION      1st ed.
PUB INFO     New York : Tor, 2012.
DESCRIPT     304 p. ; 22 cm.
NOTE         "A Tom Doherty Associates book."
NOTE         "Jane Eliot wears an iron mask. It's the only way to contain the 
               fey curse that scars her cheek. The Great War is five years 
               gone, but its scattered victims remain--the ironskin. When a 
               carefully worded listing appears for a governess to assist with
               a "delicate situation"--a child born during the Great War--Jane
               is certain the child is fey-cursed, and that she can help. 
               Teaching the unruly Dorie to suppress her curse is hard enough;
               she certainly didn't expect to fall for the girl's father, the 
               enigmatic artist Edward Rochart. But her blossoming crush is 
               stifled by her scars and by his parade of women. Ugly women, 
               who enter his closed studio...and come out as beautiful as the 
               fey. Jane knows Rochart cannot love her, just as she knows that
               she must wear iron for the rest of her life. But what if 
               neither of these things are true? Step by step Jane unlocks the
               secrets of a new life--and discovers just how far she will go 
               to become whole again. "-- Provided by publisher.

               'hungries'. Only a small group of children seem to be immune to
               its effects. At an army base in rural England, these unique 
               children are being studied and subjected to cruel experiments. 
               When the base falls, one little girl escapes and must discover 
               what she is, ultimately deciding both her own future and that 
               of the human race.

NOTE         In the tradition of Star Wars, a galaxy-hopping space adventure 
               about a galactic kingdom bent on control and the young misfit 
               who must find the power within before it's too late. Cade Sura 
               holds the future of the galaxy in his hands: the ultimate 
               weapon that will bring total peace. He didn't ask for it, he 
               doesn't want it, and there's no worse choice to wield it in all
               of space, but if he doesn't, everyone's totally screwed. The 
               evil Praxis kingdom is on the cusp of having every star system 
               under its control, and if that happens, there'll be no 
               contesting their cruel reign. Especially if its fanatical 
               overlord, Ga Halle, manages to capture Cade and snag the all-
               powerful weapon for herself. Cade can't hide from Praxis, and 
               he can't run from the destiny that's been shoved into his
               hands. So he only has one option: He has to fight. Cade's not 
               going to let destiny send him on a suicide run, though. With 
               some help from his friends--rebels and scoundrels alike--Cade's
               going to use this weapon to chart a new destiny for the galaxy,
               and for himself. He just has to do so before everyone around 
               him discovers that he's a complete and total fraud. Blending 
               the space operatics of Star Wars and the swagger of Guardians 
               of the Galaxy, Black Star Renegades is a galaxy-hopping 
               adventure that blasts its way from seedy spacer bars to sacred 
               temples guarded by deadly creatures--all with a cast of misfit 
               characters who have nowhere to go and nothing to lose.

NOTE         "The second entry in the Star Wars-inspired series that Nerdist 
               calls "the next big thing." Though the ragtag group of misfits 
               known as the Black Star Renegades won a decisive battle by 
               destroying Ga Halle's War Hammer, the war is far from over. In 
               response to losing the crown jewel of its fleet, the evil 
               Praxis empire has vengefully reinforced its tyranny across the 
               galaxy--but its rule won't be had so easily. Led by hotshot 
               pilot Kira Sen, a growing rebel force stands in the way of 
               Praxis's might. Not only do they possess the will to fight for 
               galactic freedom, they also possess the ultimate ace in the 
               hole: The mythical Rokura, the most powerful weapon ever known.
               Too bad Cade Sura hasn't figured out to use it. As Kira wages 
               an increasingly bloody war against Praxis, Cade is left with 
               only once choice: With Ga Halle scouring every star system for 
               the coveted weapon, Cade embarks on a dangerous mission into 
               uncharted space to discover the Rokura's origins. Only then can
               he learn how it can be wielded. Because if he doesn't, all hope
               for the galaxy might be lost" -- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         "An exciting new book in the series featuring woman-on-the-run 
               Elizabeth Miles--from the beloved national bestselling author 
               of the Gaslight Mysteries. Con artist Elizabeth Miles has 
               determined that Society is the biggest con of all. So far, 
               Elizabeth's only real social success has been with Priscilla 
               Knight. Priscilla is a dedicated suffragist who was recently 
               widowed for the second time in her young life. Her beloved 
               first husband, DeForrest Jenks, died in a tragic accident and 
               left her with two young daughters and a comfortable fortune. 
               Soon after his death, her pastor convinced her she needed a man
               to look after her. Before she knew it, he had engineered a 
               whirlwind courtship and hasty marriage to fellow parishioner 
               Endicott Knight. Less than nine months later, Endicott is also 
               dead in a somewhat less tragic and even more suspicious 
               accident. Priscilla confides to Elizabeth that she had 
               understood Endicott was wealthy in his own right, and she had 
               brought a sizeable fortune to the marriage as well. Now her 
               banker is telling her she has hardly any money left and that 
               her house has been mortgaged. The banker has hinted at a 
               scandal that could damage the family's reputation and her 
               daughters' future prospects. Fearing destructive gossip, 
               Priscilla doesn't know whom to trust. Elizabeth discovers some 
               unsavory evidence that seems to point to the possibility that 
               Endicott's death may have been connected to blackmail. To save 
               her new friend's future, Elizabeth must use her special set of 
               skills to find the truth"-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         Venice, 1586. William Shakespeare is disguised as a steward to 
               the English Ambassador. He and his actor friends, Oldcastle and
               Hemming, possess a deadly secret: the names of the Catholic 
               spies in England who seek to destroy Queen Elizabeth. Before 
               long the Popes agents begin to close in on them, so fleeing the
               city is the players only option. In Verona, Aemelia, the 
               daughter of a Duke, is struggling to conceal her passionate 
               affair with her cousin Valentine. But darker times lie ahead 
               with the arrival of the sinister Father Thornhill, who is 
               determined to seek out anyone who doesn't conform to the Pope's
               ruthless agenda . . . Events will converge in the forests 
               around Verona as a multitude of plots are hatched and 
               discovered, players fall in and out of love, and disguises are 
               adopted and then discarded. Will the brash William Shakespeare 
               and his friends escape with their secrets--and their lives?

               too many, young William Shakespeare flees Stratford to seek his
               fortune. Cast adrift in London, Will falls in with a band of 
               players, but greater men have their eye on this talented young 
               wordsmith. England's very survival hangs in the balance and 
               Will finds himself dispatched to Venice on a crucial
               assignment. Dazzled by the city's masques and its beauties, he 
               little realizes the peril in which he finds himself. Catholic 
               assassins would stop at nothing to end his mission on the point
               of their sharpened knives--and lurking in the shadows is a 
               killer as clever as he is cruel. Suspenseful, seductive, and as
               sharp as an assassin's blade, The Spy of Venice introduces a 
               major new literary talent to the genre--thrilling if you've 
               never read a word of Shakespeare and sublime if you have.

NOTE         Orson Scott Card and Aaron Johnston return to their Ender's Game 
               prequel series with this first volume of an all-new trilogy 
               about the Second Formic War in The Swarm. The first invasion of
               Earth was beaten back by a coalition of corporate and 
               international military forces, and the Chinese army. China has 
               been devastated by the Formic's initial efforts to eradicate 
               Earth life forms and prepare the ground for their own 
               settlement. The Scouring of China struck fear into the other 
               nations of the planet; that fear blossomed into drastic action 
               when scientists determined that the single ship that wreaked 
               such damage was merely a scout ship. There is a mothership out 
               beyond the Solar System's Kuiper Belt, and it's heading into 
               the system, unstoppable by any weapons that Earth can muster. 
               Earth has been reorganized for defense. There is now a Hegemon,
               a planetary official responsible for keeping all the formerly 
               warring nations in line. There's a Polemarch, responsible for 
               organizing all the military forces of the planet into the new 
               International Fleet. But there is an enemy within, an enemy as 
               old as human warfare: ambition and politics. Greed and self-
               interest. Will Bingwen, Mazer Rackam, Victor Delgado and Lem 
               Juke be able to divert those very human enemies in time to 
               create a weapon that can effectively defend humanity in the 
               inexorable Second Formic War?

NOTE         As 1899 draws to a close, Frank and Sarah Malloy are ready to 
               celebrate the New Year--and century--at Trinity Church when 
               they notice Mr. Pritchard, a neighbor's relative, behaving 
               oddly and annoying the other revelers. When Frank tries to 
               intervene and convince Pritchard to return home with them, he 
               refuses and Frank loses him in the crowd. The next morning 
               Sarah and Frank are horrified to learn Pritchard was murdered 
               sometime in the night, his body left on Trinity Place, mere 
               steps from the incident. The police don't seem very invested in
               solving the crime, and the family is concerned that the 
               irregular circumstances of the death will reflect badly on 
               Pritchard's reputation. They ask Frank to investigate. To 
               prevent scandal, and catch the killer, Frank and Sarah must 
               search Pritchard's past for a link between the new crimes...and
               old sins.

NOTE         "Cult of the Dead Cow is the tale of the oldest, most respected, 
               and most famous American hacking group of all time. Though 
               until now it has remained mostly anonymous, its members 
               invented the concept of hacktivism, released the top tool for 
               testing password security, and created what was for years the 
               best technique for controlling computers from afar, forcing 
               giant companies to work harder to protect customers. They 
               contributed to the development of Tor, the most important 
               privacy tool on the net, and helped build cyberweapons that 
               advanced US security without injuring anyone. With its origins 
               in the earliest days of the Internet, the cDc is full of 
               oddball characters--activists, artists, and musicians--some of 
               whom went on to advise presidents, cabinet members, and CEOs, 
               who now walk the corridors of power in Washington and Silicon 
               Valley.  Today, the group and its followers are battling 
               electoral misinformation, making personal data safer, and 
               organizing to keep technology a force for good instead of for 
               surveillance and oppression. Cult of the Dead Cow describes
               how, at a time when governments, corporations, and criminals 
               hold immense power, a small band of tech iconoclasts is on our 
               side fighting back"--Dust jacket flap.

NOTE         "Chancing an improbable stretch of sobriety, unlicensed P.I. Duck
               Darley has proven himself stronger than the temptations that 
               loom in the seedy underbelly of New York City. But the familiar
               urge to tear it all apart lingers like garbage in July when 
               Layla Soto, a sharp-tongued Park Avenue teenager with a family 
               as screwed up as his own, presents a twisted missing-persons 
               case he can't refuse. Layla saw her billionaire father get 
               abducted by two enigmatic women in the tallest residential 
               tower on earth, and suspects her grandmother, a Chinese social 
               climber on husband number three, orchestrated the act to 
               eliminate her only son. Duck agrees to investigate the hedge 
               funder's disappearance, if only for the rush of a new thrill--
               and an excuse to reconcile with Cass Kimball, his black latex-
               clad former business partner who nearly got him killed. As the 
               unlikely duo becomes immersed in a high-stakes ransom linked to
               the international drug trade and the most powerful criminals 
               alive, surviving means trusting no one. Because how long can a 
               person live on the edge before falling?"--Provided by

NOTE         Uhtred of Bebbanburg has won back his ancestral home but, 
               threatened from all sides by enemies both old and new, he
               doesn't have long to enjoy the victory. In Mercia, rebellion is
               in the air as King Edward tries to seize control. In Wessex, 
               rival parties scramble to settle on the identity of the next 
               king. And across the country invading Norsemen continue their 
               relentless incursion, ever hungry for land. Uhtred finds 
               himself once again torn between his two heritages.For decades, 
               Uhtred has stood at the intersection between Pagan and 
               Christian, between Saxon and Viking, between the old world he 
               was born into and the new world being forged around him. But as
               the winds of change gather pace, the pressure on Uhtred as 
               father, as politician and as warrior grows as never before.

SERIES       Crosby, Ellen, 1953- Wine country mystery ; 10.
NOTE         Series numeration from www.goodreads.com.
NOTE         "When Lucie Montgomery attends a Thanksgiving weekend party for 
               friends and neighbors at Hawthorne Castle, an honest-to-
               goodness castle owned by the Avery family, the last great 
               newspaper dynasty in America and owner of the Washington 
               Tribune, she doesn't expect the festive occasion to end in 
               death. During the party, Prescott Avery, the 95-year old family
               patriarch, invites Lucie to his fabulous wine cellar where he 
               offers to pay any price for a cache of 200-year-old Madeira 
               that her great-great-uncle, a Prohibition bootlegger, 
               discovered hidden in the US Capitol in the 1920s. Lucie knows 
               nothing about the valuable wine, believing her late father, a 
               notorious gambler and spendthrift, probably sold or drank it. 
               By the end of the party Lucie and her fiancé, winemaker Quinn 
               Santori, discover Prescott's body lying in his wine cellar. Is 
               one of the guests a murderer? As Lucie searches for the lost 
               Madeira, which she believes links Prescott's death to a cryptic
               letter her father owned, she learns about Prescott's 
               affiliation with the Freemasons. More investigating hints at a 
               mysterious vault supposedly containing documents hidden by the 
               Founding Fathers and a possible tie to William Shakespeare. If 
               Lucie finds the long-lost documents, the explosive revelations 
               could change history. But will she uncover a three hundred
               -year-old secret before a determined killer finds her?"--

               Strangers flock here hoping the natural hot springs, five-star 
               cuisine, and renowned spa can cure their ills. If none of that 
               works, they often find their way to Miracle Books, where, over 
               a fresh-baked 'comfort' scone from the Gingerbread House
               bakery, they exchange their stories with owner Nora Pennington 
               in return for a carefully chosen book. That's Nora's special 
               talent -- prescribing the perfect novel to ease a person's 
               deepest pain and lighten their heaviest burden. When a visiting
               businessman reaches out to Nora for guidance, she knows exactly
               which novels will help. But before he can keep their 
               appointment at Miracle Books, he's found dead on the train 
               tracks. Stunned, Nora forms the Secret, Book, and Scone
               Society, a group of damaged souls yearning to gain trust and 
               earn redemption by helping others. To join the society, members
               must divulge their darkest secret -- the terrible truth that 
               brought each of them to Miracle Springs in the first place. 
               Determined to uncover the truth behind the businessman's
               demise, the women meet in Nora's cramped and cozy bookstore to 
               share stories and trade support. And as they untangle a web of 
               corruption, they also discover their own courage, purpose, and 
               a sisterhood that will carry them through every challenge -- 
               proving it's never too late to turn the page and start over..."

SERIES       Anderson, Taylor, 1963- Destroyermen.
NOTE         Time is running out for the Grand Human and Lemurian Alliance. 
               The longer they take to prepare for their confrontations with 
               the reptilian Grik, the Holy Dominion, and the League of 
               Tripoli, the stronger their enemies become. Ready or not, they 
               have to move - or the price in blood will break them. Matt 
               Reddy and his battered old destroyer USS Walker lead the 
               greatest army the humans and their Lemurian allies have ever 
               assembled up the Zambezi toward the ancient Grik capital city. 
               Standing against them is the largest, most dangerous force of 
               Grik yet gathered. On the far side of the world, General Shinya
               and his Army of the Sisters are finally prepared for their
               long-expected assault on the mysterious El Paso del Fuego. Not 
               only is the dreaded Dominion ready and waiting for them; 
               they've formed closer, more sinister ties with the fascist 
               League of Tripoli.

NOTE         When she moved to Stoneham, city slicker Tricia Miles met nothing

               she met friendly competition. But when she finds Doris Gleason 
               dead in her own cookbook store, killed by a carving knife, the 
               atmosphere seems more cutthroat than cordial. Someone wanted to
               get their hands on the rare cookbook that Doris had recently 
               purchased-and the locals think that someone is Tricia. To clear
               her name, Tricia will have to take a page out of one of her own
               mysteries-and hunt down someone who isn't killing by the book.

NOTE         "Open revolt has been thwarted -- for now -- but unrest still 
               simmers in the Kingdom of Galitha. Sophie, despite having built
               a thriving business on her skill at both dressmaking and magic,
               has not escaped unscathed from her misadventures in the
               workers' rebellion. Her dangerous foray into curse casting has 
               rendered her powers unpredictable, and her increasingly visible
               romantic entanglement with the Crown Prince makes her a 
               convenient target for threatened nobles and malcontented 
               commoners alike. With domestic political reform and 
               international alliances -- and her own life -- at stake, Sophie
               must discern friend from foe... before her magic grows too dark
               for her to wield" -- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         For the past year, their close loss in the annual Boarding Games 
               has haunted the NeoG Interceptor Team Zuma's Ghost. With this 
               year's competition looming, they're looking forward to some 
               payback--until an unexpected personnel change leaves them 
               reeling. Their best swordsman has been transferred, and a new 
               lieutenant has been assigned in his place. Maxine Carmichael is
               trying to carve a place in the world on her own--away from the 
               pressure and influence of her powerful family. The last thing 
               she wants is to cause trouble at her command on Jupiter
               Station. With her new team in turmoil, Max must overcome her 
               self-doubt and win their trust if she's going to succeed. 
               Failing is not an option--and would only prove her parents 
               right. But Max and the team must learn to work together
               quickly. A routine mission to retrieve a missing ship has 
               suddenly turned dangerous, and now their lives are on the line.
               Someone is targeting members of Zuma's Ghost, a mysterious 
               opponent willing to kill to safeguard a secret that could shake
               society to its core . . . a secret that could lead to their 
               deaths and kill thousands more unless Max and her new team stop
               them. Rescue those in danger, find the bad guys, win the Games.
               It's all in a day's work at the NeoG.

NOTE         "The Last Hand of the Oversight still patrols the border between 
               the natural and supernatural, holding a candle to the darkness.
               But this new Hand is unproven, its fresh members untrained, its
               veterans weary and battle-scarred. Their vulnerability brings 
               new enemies into the city, and surprising new allies from 
               across the sea. But most surprising of all are new revelations 
               about the Oversight's past, revelations that will expose the 
               true peril of the world in which Sharp and Sara are trapped -- 
               the secret of the Black Mirrors, and what lies beyond. And the 
               catastrophic danger that will follow them home, if they ever 
               manage to return. The dark waters rise. The candles are 
               guttering. But the light still remains. For now..."--provided

NOTE         "In this epic conclusion to the Unraveled Kingdom trilogy that 
               began with Torn and Fray, the magical seamstress Sophie 
               Balstrade joins forces with her brother the revolutionary 
               leader and her betrothed the Crown Prince in a deadly bid to 
               change history. The civil war that the charm caster Sophie and 
               the Crown Prince Theodor tried so desperately to avert has come
               to Galitha. While Theodor joins Sophie's brother and his 
               Reformist comrades in battle, hoping to turn the tide against 
               the better-supplied and better-trained Royalist army, Sophie 
               leverages the only weapon she has: charm and curse casting. She
               weaves her signature magic into uniforms and supplies procured 
               with the aid of unlikely foreign allies, but soon discovers 
               that the challenges of a full-scale war are far greater than 
               the entrepreneurial concerns of her small Galithan dress shop. 
               The fractured leadership of the Reformist army must coalesce, 
               the people of Galitha unite against enormous odds, and Sophie 
               create more than a little magical luck, in order to have a 
               chance of victory"-- Provided by publisher.

               their first target are the people of Loch Beag. Lead by the 
               peerless Tzatzini, all that stands in the way of the God 
               Emperor's grasp of power is Aoelyn, Talmadge, and their few 
               remaining allies. But not all hope is lost. Far away from 
               Fireach Speuer, an ancient tomb is uncovered by Brother 
               Thaddeus of the Abellican Church. Within it is the power to 
               stop the onslaught of coming empire and, possibly, reshape the

SERIES       Barrett, Lorna. Booktown mystery.
NOTE         "Tricia Miles, owner of Haven't Got a Clue mystery bookstore, is 
               still settling into Stoneham, New Hampshire, the kind of town 
               where everybody knows your name--and where everyone's quick to 
               lend a hand, even when murder is afoot... The kinder folks of 
               Stoneham might call Pammy Fredericks a free spirit. The less 
               kind, a freeloading thief. Tricia has put up--and put up with--
               her uninvited college roommate for weeks. In return, Pammy has 
               stolen one hundred dollars, among other things. But the day
               she's kicked out, Pammy's found dead in a trash cart, leaving 
               loads of questions unanswered. What was she foraging for? Did 
               her killer want it, too? To piece the case together, Tricia 
               will have to dive in headfirst..."--p. [4] of cover.

NOTE         "As the owner of Miracle Books, Nora Pennington figures all the 
               wet weather this spring is at least good for business. The 
               local inns are packed with stranded travelers, and among them 
               Nora finds both new customers and a new friend, the sixty-
               something Sheldon, who starts helping out at the store. Since a
               little rain never hurt anyone, Nora rides her bike over to the 
               flea market one sodden day and buys a bowl from Danny, a 
               Cherokee potter. It'll make a great present for Nora's EMT 
               boyfriend, but the next day, a little rain turns into a lot of 
               rain, and the Miracle River overflows it banks. Amid the 
               wreckage of a collapsed footbridge, Danny's body lies within 
               the churning water. Nora and the sheriff both doubt the ruling 
               of accidental drowning, and Nora decides it's time for the 
               Secret, Book, and Scone Society to spring into action. When 
               another body turns up, it becomes clearer that Danny's death 
               can't be blamed on a natural disaster. A crucial clue may lie 
               within the stone walls of the Inn of Mist and Roses: a diary, 
               over a century old and spattered with candle wax, that leads 
               Nora and her friends through a maze of intrigue--and onto the 
               trail of a murderer..."-- Publisher's description.

               portraying fictional characters from popular culture through

               and playing with different identities.

               in Nessus, representative of the secretive Puppeteers, the 
               elder race who wield vastly superior technologies. Nessus 
               schemes in the shadows with Earth's traitors and adversaries, 
               even after the race he represents abruptly vanishes from Known

NOTE         "The Obsidian Tower begins a bold new epic fantasy trilogy in 
               which the broken magic of one woman will either save an entire 
               continent-or completely destroy it. As the granddaughter of a 
               Witch Lord of Vaskandar, Ryx was destined for power and 
               prestige. But a childhood illness left her with broken magic 
               that drains the life from anything she touches, and Vaskandar 
               has no place for a mage with unusable powers. So Ryx has 
               resigned herself to an isolated life as the warden of 
               Gloamingard, her grandmother's castle. At Gloamingard's heart 
               lies a black tower. Sealed by magic, it guards a dangerous 
               secret that has been contained for thousands of years. Until 
               one impetuous decision Ryx makes leaves her with blood on her 
               hands-and unleashes a threat that could doom everything she 
               loves to fall to darkness"-- Provided by publisher.

               fictional heroines like Roald Dahl's Matilda and Madeline 
               Miller's Circe. A family-values group disapproves of the 
               magical themes, though, and wastes no time launching a modern-
               day witch hunt. They're targeting not only Nora and Miracle 
               Books, but a new shopkeeper, Celeste, who has been selling CBD 
               oil products. When a local death is declared an accident, the 
               ruling can't explain the old book page covered with strange 
               symbols and disturbing drawings left under Nora's doormat, a 
               postcard from an anonymous stalker, or multiple cases of 
               vandalism. The Secret, Book, and Scone Society investigate 
               before more bodies turn up and the secrets from Celeste's past 
               come back to haunt them all. -- adapted from jacket.

NOTE         Introduction -- The abandoned road -- The great utopia --

               planning -- Planning and democracy -- Planning and the rule of

NOTE         An unimpeachable classic work in political philosophy, 
               intellectual and cultural history, and economics, The Road to 
               Serfdom has inspired and infuriated politicians, scholars, and 
               general readers for half a century. Originally published in 
               1944 -- when Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin,
               and Albert Einstein subscribed lock, stock, and barrel to the 
               socialist program --The Road to Serfdom was seen as heretical 
               for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control
               over the means of production. For F. A. Hayek, the collectivist
               idea of empowering government with increasing economic control 
               would lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of Nazi Germany 
               and Fascist Italy.  With this new edition, The Road to Serfdom 
               takes its place in the series The Collected Works of F. A. 
               Hayek. The volume includes a foreword by series editor and 
               leading Hayek scholar Brude Caldwell explaining the book's 
               origins and publishing history and assessing common 
               misinterpretations of Hayek's thought. Caldwell has also 
               standardized and corrected Hayek's references and added helpful
               new explanatory notes. Supplemented with an appendix of related
               materials ranging from prepublication reports on the initial 
               manuscript to forewords to earlier editions by John
               Chamberlain, Milton Friedman, and Hayek himself, this new 
               edition of The Road to Serfdom will be the definitive version 
               of Friedrich Hayek's enduring masterwork.

               magic is scarce and those born with power are strictly 
               controlled -- taken as children and conscripted into the Falcon
               Army. Zaira has lived her life on the streets to avoid this 
               fate, hiding her mage-mark and thieving to survive. But hers is
               a rare and dangerous magic, one that threatens the entire 
               empire. Lady Amalia Cornaro was never meant to be a Falconer. 
               Heiress and scholar, she was born into a treacherous world of 
               political machinations. But fate has bound the heir and the 
               mage. And as war looms on the horizon, a single spark could 
               turn their city into a pyre. The Tethered Mage is the first

TITLE        The five dysfunctions of a team : a leadership fable / Patrick 
               Lencioni.
EDITION      1st ed.
PUB INFO     San Francisco : Jossey-Bass, c2002.
DESCRIPT     ix, 229 p. : ill. ; 22 cm.
NOTE         After her first two weeks observing the problems at DecisionTech,
               Kathryn Petersen, its new CEO, had more than a few moments when
               she wondered if she should have taken the job. But Kathryn knew
               there was little chance she would have turned it down. After 
               all, retirement had made her antsy, and nothing excited her 
               more than a challenge. What she could not have known when she 
               accepted the job, however, was just how dysfunctional her team 
               was, and how team members would challenge her in ways that no 
               one ever had before. In this book, the author turns his keen 
               intellect and storytelling power to the fascinating, complex 
               world of teams. Kathryn Petersen, DecisionTech's CEO, faces the
               ultimate leadership crisis: uniting a team that is in such 
               disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. 
               Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? The
               author's story serves as a timeless reminder that leadership 
               requires as much courage as it does insight. Throughout the 
               story, he reveals the five dysfunctions that go to the very 
               heart of why teams, even the best ones, often struggle. He 
               outlines a powerful model and actionable steps that can be used
               to overcome these common hurdles and build a cohesive,

NOTE         "Across the border, the Witch Lords of Vaskandar are preparing 
               for war. But before an invasion can begin, they must call a 
               rare gathering of all seventeen lords to decide a course of 
               action. Lady Amalia Cornaro knows that this Conclave might be 
               her only chance to smother the growing flames of war, and she 
               is ready to make any sacrifice if it means saving Raverra from 
               destruction. Amalia and Zaira must go behind enemy lines, using
               every ounce of wit and cunning they have, to sway Vaskandar 
               from war. Or else it will all come down to swords and fire.

SERIES       The Artillerymen Series.
NOTE         "On their way to fight in the Mexican-American War, a group of 
               American soldiers are swept away to a strange and deadly 
               alternate Earth in this thrilling new adventure set in the 
               world of the New York Times bestselling Destroyermen series. 
               The United States, 1847. A disparate group of young American 
               soldiers are bound to join General Winfield Scott's campaign 
               against Santa Anna at Veracruz during the Mexican-American War.
               They never arrive. Or rather . . . they arrive somewhere else. 
               The untried, idealistic soldiers are mostly replacements, 
               really; a handful of infantry, artillery, dragoons, and a few 
               mounted riflemen with no unified command. And they've been 
               shipwrecked on a terrible, different Earth full of monsters and
               unimaginable enemies. Major Lewis Cayce, late of the 3rd US 
               "Flying" Artillery, must unite these men to face their fears 
               and myriad threats, armed with little more than flintlock 
               muskets, a few pieces of artillery, and a worldview that 
               spiritually and culturally rebels against virtually everything 
               they encounter. It will take extraordinary leadership and a 
               cadre of equally extraordinary men and women to mold frightened
               troops into an effective force, make friends with other peoples
               the evil Holy Dominion would eradicate, and reshape their 
               "manifest destiny" into a cause they can all believe in and 
               fight for. For only together will they have any hope of 
               survival"-- Provided by publisher.

NOTE         "In this all-new Counterfeit Lady Novel from USA Today 
               bestselling author Victoria Thompson, newlywed Elizabeth Bates 
               must use her unlawful skills to expose a dangerous charlatan. 
               Elizabeth Bates has returned from her honeymoon with Gideon and
               is taking great pride in having completely forsaken her 
               disreputable past. But then, her friend Anna Vanderslice begs 
               her to use her talents to save Anna's widowed mother from an 
               unscrupulous medium. Since the war and the flu epidemic left so
               many families in mourning, séances have come back into vogue as
               desperate families long to communicate with their loved ones. 
               Anna's mother has been attending séances in hopes of connecting
               with her son, David, who died of influenza. Anna had thought it
               a heartbreaking but harmless activity, although she has just 
               learned that Mrs. Vanderslice is paying the medium ever-
               increasing sums of money in her eagerness to make contact. 
               Since David's death has already caused Anna and her mother 
               financial hardship, Mrs. Vanderslice's obsession is in danger 
               of ruining them. Madame Ophelia is working with a group of con 
               artists to fleece as many grieving New Yorkers as possible 
               before moving on to another city. Several of Mrs. Vanderslice's
               friends, as well as some of Gideon's clients, have already been
               victims. Elizabeth knows that simply exposing the medium as a 
               fraud will not be enough to recoup the stolen money; the only 
               way is to con the medium and her cohorts. But will Elizabeth's 
               family help her when it means betraying other con artists? 
               Elizabeth recruits Gideon, her aunt Cybil and her partner, 
               Zelda, to lend a hand. Can Elizabeth and her gang of amateurs 
               fool the professionals? Or will speaking to the dead lead to 
               deadly consequences?"-- Provided by publisher.
